    <p align="right"><i>"<font size="54px">Inspiration</font>has something in common with a convulsion, and that every sublime thought is accompanied by a more or less violent nervous shock which has its repercussion in the very core of the brain. The man of <a href="https://www.billboard.com/files/media/frank-ocean-650px.jpg"> genius</a> has sound nerves, while those of a child are weak. With the one, Reason has taken up a considerable position; with the other, Sensibility is almost the whole being. But genius is nothing more nor less than childhood recovered at will — a childhood now equipped for self-expression with manhood’s capacities and a power of analysis which enables it to order <font color="silver">the mass of raw material which it has involuntarily accumulated.</font></i> </p>

    <p align="center"> <font size="55px"> And</font> I think if I had to do it all over again what would I have done? Would I have worn a leather shirt? Would I have drank half a bottle of Hennessy and gave the rest of it to the audience? Ya'll know ya'll drank that bottle too! If I had a daughter at that time would I have went on stage and grabbed the mic from someone else's? You know, this arena tomorrow it's gonna be a completely different setup. Some concert, something like that. The stage will be gone. <font color="purple">After that night, the stage was gone, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7mLs9LeQB4"> but the effect that it had on people remained.</a></font>

    <p align="left"><i>Our <font size="65px">aesthetic sense </font>, whether in works of art or in lives, has overfocused on the stubborn struggle toward a single goal rather than on the fluid, the protean, the improvisatory. <font color="Orange">We see achievement as purposeful and monolithic</font>, like the sculpting of a massive tree trunk that has first to be brought from the forest and then shaped by long labor to assert the artist’s <a href="https://interventionsjournal.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/4.pngvision"> vision </a> rather than something crafted from odds and ends, like a patchwork quilt, and lovingly used to warm different nights and bodies.</i></p>
