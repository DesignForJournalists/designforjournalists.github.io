			<p>&ldquo;It is good to feel lost... because it proves you have a navigational sense of where "home" is. You know that a place that feels like being found exists. And maybe your current location isn't that place but, <em>Hallelujah</em>, that unsettled, uneasy feeling of lost-ness just brought you closer to it.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>&ldquo;You cannot dream yourself into a character; you must hammer and forge yourself one. Go out into life, you will find your chance there, and only there.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>Enough, <strong><em>enough</strong></em>, dear watch,</p>
			<p>Thy pulse hath beat enough. Now sleep and rest;</p>
			<p>Would thou could'st make the time to do so too;</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Why do we treat the fleeting day</p>
			<p>with so much needless fear and sorrow?</p>
			<p>It's in its nature not to stay:</p>
			<p>Today is always gone tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
