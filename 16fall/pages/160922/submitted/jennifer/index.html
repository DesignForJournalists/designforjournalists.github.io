        <h2>1. Seung Sahn Soen-sa</h2>
        
        <p class="soen-sa"><span class="first">"L</span>et’s say we have a glass of water. Now its temperature is about 60 degrees. If you reduce the temperature to 20 degrees, it becomes ice. If you raise the temperature above <span class="loud"><bold>212</bold></span> degrees, it will become stream. As the temperature changes, H20 in the form of water appears and disappears, but H20 does not appears and does not disappear. Ice, water, and steam are only its form. Name and form change, but H20 does not change. If you understand the temperature, then you understand the form. Your true self is like this.<span class="dot-one">"</span>

        <h2>2. Charles Baudelaire</h2>
        
        <p class="baudelaire"><span class="second">"T</span>he child sees everything in a state of newness; he is always drunk. Nothing more resembles what we call inspiration than the delight with which a small child absorbs form and colour.<span class="dot-two">"</span></p>

         <h2>3. Mary Catherine Bateson</h2>
        <p class="bateson"><span class="third">"I</span>t is time now to explore the creative potential of interrupted and conflicted lives, where energies are not narrowly focused or permanently pointed toward a single ambition. These are not lives without commitment, but rather lives in which commitments are continually refocused and redefined. We must invest time and passion in specific goals and at the same time acknowledge that these are mutable.The circumstances of women’s lives now and in the past provide examples for new ways of thinking about the lives of both men and women. What are the possible transfers of learning when life is a collage of different tasks? How does creativity flourish on distraction? What insights arise from the experience of multiplicity and ambiguity? And at what point does desperate improvisation become significant achievement? These are important questions in a world in which we are all increasingly strangers and sojourners. The knight errant, who finds his challenges along the way, may be a better model for our times than the knight who is questing for the Grail.<span class="dot-three">"</span></p>
