        <h1>Just-Like-That Mind: A Great Zen Teacher on Navigating Loss and Greif</h1>
        <h2> In this assignment, I took inspiring quotes from Maria Popova's, Brain Pickings and posted them below with other paragraphs to give context to the background and meaning.</h2>
        <p class="section-uno"> In August of 1977, shortly after explaining death and the life-force to a child, Soen-sa received a letter from a man named Sheldon, whose father had just died the day before. As Sheldon grapples with the universal and universally gutting experience of loss and grief, central to which is the paralyzing perplexity of how a self so beloved and so known can simply disappear into the unknown, he turns to the great teacher for insight and consolation. Soen-sa writes back:</p>
        <p class="soen-sa">"Zen is the great work of life and death. What is life? What is death? When you attain this, then everything is clear, everything is complete, and everything is freedom."</p>
        <p class="section-dos">Several years after Bruce Lee used water in his <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/05/29/like-water-bruce-lee-artist-of-life/">famous metaphor for resilence.</a>Soen-sa turns to the liquid of life to illustrate Zen’s orientation to death:</p>
        <p class="excerpt"><span class="largo">"</span>Let’s say we have a glass of water. Now its temperature is about 60 degrees. If you reduce the temperature to 20 degrees, it becomes ice. If you raise the temperature above <span class="impact">212 degrees</span>, it will become stream. As the temperature changes, H20 in the form of water appears and disappears, but H20 does not appears and does not disappear. Ice, water, and steam are only its form. Name and form change, but H20 does not change. If you understand the temperature, then you understand the form. Your true self is like this. <span class= "largo">"</span></p>

        <p class="section-tres">Soen-sa examines the paradox of the “true self” — an experience we have that feels so solid and concrete, yet remains utterly elusive as soon as we try to pinpoint its source. Our ideas about the self, he argues, are based mostly on attachments to the form of the body, generated in the mind. He writes:</p>
<!--        <img src="http://67.media.tumblr.com/a83009f8fb80b8a6d95518b79805d7de/tumblr_mv4mvormJr1re3am6o1_1280.jpg"> -->

        <p class="quotetwo">"Steam, ice, and water are all H20; but if you are attached to water, and the water becomes ice, then you say the water disappeared. So it is dead! Raise the temperature; the water is born again! Raise the temperature again; the water disappears and becomes steam, and the water is dead again!"</p>
        <p>"But name and form are made by thinking. Water does not say, “I am water.” Steam does not say, “I am steam.” If you cut off all thinking, are you and the water the same or different? Same and different are made by your thinking. How can you answer? There is no form, no emptiness — no words." <a href="http://blog.gertrude.co/post/64893727409/oliver-jeffers-measuring-land-and-sea-inside">Painting by Oliver Jeffers from his series Measuring Land and Sea.</a></p>
        <p class="excerpt">Exactly half a century after the great Zen teacher D.T. Suzuki cautioned that “the ego-shell in which we live is the hardest thing to outgrow” in his foundational text on Zen Buddhism, Soen-sa considers the main obstacle to our ability to contact this formlessness of being:</p>
        <p class="quotetwo">"If you cut off all thinking, you will see everything just as it is. Without thinking, water is water; ice is ice; steam is steam. No ideas hinder you. Then your correct relationship to H20 in any form appears by itself. We call this “just-like-this”… Just-like-this mind is clear mind. Clear mind has no I-my-me. Without I-my-me you can perceive your correct relationship to H20 and use it freely without desire for yourself. You will not suffer when water disappears and becomes ice or steam."</p>
        <p>"Your father’s original face has no death and no life… You must recognize that all things are in your own mind. Just this is finding your true self. Great love, great compassion, and the great bodhisattva [enlightenment] way come from this attainment."</p>
