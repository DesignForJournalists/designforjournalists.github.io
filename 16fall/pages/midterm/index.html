			<h1>Midterm Project</h1>

        <h1>Scope</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>You will collaborate with a classmate to create, author, and design a print the very first issue of a zine.</li>
            <li>The name of your zine is: The Newer School News.</li>
            <li>Through subject matter, voice, tone, brand, and means of distribution, the zine should evoke a certain tone, personality, set of values, and perspective.</li>
            <li>It must be printed in black and white ink.</li>
            <li>
            It must include:<br>
              - a cover (front and back)<br>
              - a masthead<br>
              - an editor’s letter<br>
              - 1 front matter article<br>
              - 1 feature article<br>
              - 1 back-matter article<br>
            </li>
            <li>It can be any size, but it must be in saddle-stitch, page-spread format.</li>
            <li>You can decide what the magazine is about. (What many things can “The Newer School News” mean? What do you want it to be?)</li>
            <li>You can decide exactly where it is distributed, exactly when, and exactly how often. Imagine your magazine not beholden in any way by distribution or financial limitations.</li>
            <li>One of you will wear the author hat. One of you will wear the designer hat. You will work together to shape the magazine.</li>
            <li>When you shape the magazine, it should implicitly or explicitly evoke: who the target audience is and why the zine worth their reading? Additionally, you should clearly be able to articulate these two things.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h1>Deliverable</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>At least 5 copies of the zine.</li>
            <li>Images of the zine for me to post on the zine collection page. Each image should be under 100kb. Stylistically, here is a nice example to follow by <a href="http://www.melissadeckert.com/#/prattonia/" target="_blank">Melissa Deckert</a></li>
            <li>A project title, subtitle, and a 70 word description, submitted in a google document that I will share.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h1>Schedule</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>The Midterm project is due November 03 and no later. (We will have a crit that day, and a guest critic). </li>
        </ul>
