			<h1>“The Newer Schools News”</h1>
		</header>
        
        <p>Below is the work students submitted for the midterm. Each student collaborated with a classmate to conceive, author, design, print, and produce the very first issue of a zine. The name of the zine had to be <em>The Newer School News</em>, but the concept was open. Through subject matter, voice, tone, brand, and means of distribution, the zine needed to evoke a certain tone, personality, set of values, and perspective. It could be any size, bound in any way, but had be printed in black and white ink, and include: a cover, a masthead, an editor’s letter, a front-matter article, a feature article, and a back-matter article. Five copies needed to be produced. Finally, in the collaboration, one student had to wear the author hat, the other the designer hat, but it was up to them how to shape that relationship.</p>

            <p>Generation Z, has done nothing but challenge the social constructs the American society has placed on us. In 2016 we have shifted culture and perception of what it means to be a boy. Boys are now allowed to be expressive, feminine and even wear make-up. The youth is the future -- Our generation is generally more accepting and welcoming which has given people the ability to live in their truth and to truly be who they want to be.</p>

The issue’s feature article highlights the recent opening of the Making Center, the first Parsons facility open to all New School students, of all disciplines. This issue reaffirms the work and practice of experienced creative individuals, as well as teaches creative confidence and agency to those who have yet to explore and alchemize the many ideas and possibilities contained in a corner-less mind.</p>

            <p><em>The Newer School News</em> is a monthly student confessional magazine that seeks to deconstruct different themes relevant to millennials through intimate interviews. The magazine is distributed in restrooms on campus as an accessible location. This issue looked at what it means to be a cyborg. Instead of viewing the media as something we consume and create, we explored it as something that inherently makes us who we are. We talked to three women of color about the impact media has on them and what they create.</p>

            <p>Fashion and creative expression through clothing is a significant part of The New School experience. Being home to one of the best design programs in the country, inspiration is easily found amongst the modish atmosphere. At such an artistically innovative school, originality regarding style and design flourishes. Our zine’s purpose is to showcase fashion and style at The New School, and how students interact with this world outside of school.</p>

            <img src="images/kamilah-melissa/zine1.jpg">
            <p>Our university captures one of New York City’s prominent traits-a magnetic pull of difference and diversity. Over 10,000 individuals from all over the country and the world ground themselves in the gloom and glitter of gotham in hopes of making the best out of what the city can offer. But to make the best out of anything, out-of-state transplants must learn how to manage the dirt and grime before completely basking in the glitter. Students reveal the methods to their madness as well as their stories on the pre and post move to the big city. This zine hopes to not only inform but also celebrate those differences and rejoice in what can bring us together. From how to manage new homes, who to follow on social, how they keep sane and how to develop and foster sustainable habits, students share how they try to live their best lives as urban dwelling New Schoolers.</p>

            <p>The creative space defines us: it brings to life our aesthetic and is a powerful tool for creation. It’s rare that we get a glimpse into the mind of the artist, but through the transformative power of creative spaces we can come to better understand not only their process, but their inspiration and struggles. Through interviews with students and NYC residents, our zine highlights community and individual spaces as well as the idea of space being more than a physical place.</p>

            <p>Internships can be integral to a person’s college experience or career, particularly at a school where the students tend to specialize in certain subjects. However, finding and applying for an internship can be intimidating, leading to many questions.  How can you find an internship? What are interviews like? How should you dress and act? We address these questions and more in this zine through feature articles that showcase two students who attend the New School who have experienced internships. They provide advice and personal anecdotes in order to help those students who may have the ambition to pursue an internship but don’t know where to start.</p>

            <p>The Newer School News hopes to focus on various topics dealing with The New School and it’s communities, policies, and issues. This issue talks discusses “New School Hacks” on how to save money by perks and student discounts specifically for currently enrolled New School students. The feature article takes a closer look at the drug prevalence throughout The New School community as well as on campus buildings/residence halls. Our main question was to see if the vague language used in The New School’s Drug and Alcohol Policy and The New School’s Residence Hall Policy was blurring the line between acceptance of drug use by its students or supporting that drug use.
