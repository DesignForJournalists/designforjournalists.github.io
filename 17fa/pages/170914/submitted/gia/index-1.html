        <p1>This quote appeared in season three of the popular reality show, Rupaul's Drag Race. The quote occured during a heated argument between two of the contestants on the show, Shangela and Mimi. I really like this quote, and find it inspiring due to how raw and emotional it is. </p1>

        <p2>"Where did this bitch hear that I had a sugar daddy? Time out. Hold up, hold up sweetheart. Let's get it together before you wanna read. I’m not even in a relationship, let alone have some old man shacked up with, that's buyin me all my drag and costumes. I don’t have a sugar daddy sweetheart, everything that I have, I’ve worked for, and I’ve worked for to get, and I’ve built myself, so I need you to know that, one hundred percent. I don't have a sugar daddy, I've never had a sugar daddy, if I wanted a sugar daddy, yes, I probably could go out and get one because I am what? SICKENING. You could never have a sugar daddy because you.are.not.that.kind.of.girl. Baby, everything I have I have worked for and I have gotten myself. I've built myself from the ground up... FUCKING BITCH!"
