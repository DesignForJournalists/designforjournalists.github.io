			<h3> Assignment: </h3>
		<p class="assignment">Choose an interview from The Great Discontent website. Scrape the text (not the images) and completely redesign the article as a print layout. Incorporate all parts of the articles anatomy including: title, byline, deck, introductory body text, pullquotes, captions. Use the "paragraph styles" panel to style each element. At the end of the article, include a section with: The name of the assignment, the class name, the instructor name, your name, and the source where you found the original article.</p>

		<h3> Reflection: </h3>
		<p class="assignment">While going through the website, I wanted to find an artist who didn't create any visual work, as to allow me to create more abstract graphic elements to support and decorate the design. Since Leon Bridges is a soul/blues singer-songwriter, I felt abstract doodled lines sparsely spread out throughout, in constrast with more thick, graphic shapes were harmonious and sensibly decorative. These were meant as visual translations of the sound of the artist's music that is featured in the article. I didn't use any color or shades of grey, as black and white sufficed and kept a clean design. A two-column grid was used for the interview as it was the most readable and allowed for pull-quotes. To differentiate between interviewee and interviewer, the questions were in a bold typeface. For the headline and pull-quotes, I used Gastromond, a google font that has a nostalgic feel to it that reflected Bridges' sound. As secondary typeface, for the rest of the text, I used Georgia, a classic serif literary font for easy readabilty and scannability. </p>
		<p class="assignment">To me this assignment was really about learning to get comfortable with inDesign and get over my fear of it. It wasn't my favorite adobe application, I am a big illustrator gal. The trickiest part, I must say, were the texts wrapped around the curved shapes and lines. Not only did I have to consider the distribution and weight of the text and white-space from afar on a big picture scale, but also looking at the text and making sure it still flowed and read properly. </p>
