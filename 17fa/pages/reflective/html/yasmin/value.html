			<h3> Reflection: </h3>
			<p class="assignment"> Overall I can say that for myself, I have learned a lot in this class. By that I don't mean just about the theory of design in a journalism context, but about its actual application. Producing a print zine from scratch as a whole has been very eye-opening and probably the most important process that I will take with me in my future endeavours. I adore print as a medium and wish to work on many an editorial project in my career, so having gone through the experience from planting the seed of an idea, conceptualizing it and bringing it to life has exposed me to (I think) all the aspects, roles, and limitations that come into play when producing a print product. This also kind of summarizes and groups all of the skills and tools we covered through the course of the semester. So everything from deciding on an aesthetic to translate certain values and a certain voice, to figuring out a grid system, to understanding the role of and boundaries set by bleed and crop marks, to picking the right paper. All of the above. </p>
