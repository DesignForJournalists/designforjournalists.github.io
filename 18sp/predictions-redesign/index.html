          <p class="intro">For Part 01 of the semester, students collaborated in groups to strategically and systematically rethink the redesign of the <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/collection/predictions-2018/" target="_blank">NiemanLab 2018 Predictions website</a>. Below are write-ups explaining each group's redesigned website, and links to redesigns. Here is the original assigment:</p>
          <p class="intro assignment">You will work in a group of 3-4 students. Work with your group to build a website using HTML/CSS. The website should have one homepage and 3-4 article pages (depending on the number of people in your group). You will use the content and elements from . By default, there should be content parity. Any subtractions or additions should be a deliberate move to improve the site. Each group will assign each member a specific role (lead designer, lead developer, lead editor, product manager, etc). Each person in the group will be responsible for designing/coding their own article page, and each person's article page should draw use the exact same CSS file. The homepage should be designed/coded together. Finally, you will write a project writeup that outlines what you did, and what problems/strengths/tenets drove your redesign/development</p>
          <p class="intro">Final note: This webpage itself and the write-up pages were designed and coded using a template based on one of the group's redesign project.</p>
