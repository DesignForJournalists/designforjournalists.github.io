        Our Systems Design assignment required us to code a redesigned version of the NeimanLab Predictions for 2018 Journalism website. As a group, we analyzed the strengths and weaknesses of the design of the site and coded a new website based off of the decisions that we made.

         Design Analysis:
        </h3>    
    <p>
        The original NeimanLab 2018 Predictions website offered a mix of diverse strengths, opportunities, and weaknesses as a starting point for developing our redesigned site. The major problem that we noticed on the site was that it was unclear where the reader should be clicking. 
    </p>     
    <p>
        Because there was so much information on the homepage, it was also difficult to understand the hierarchy in importance of the text and photos. One thing we liked about the design of the site was the incorporation of the quotes with the photos of the featured journalists. We saw opportunities to make the content the focus of the site by toning back the design overall. We went with more clean and simple design for the website. 
    </p>
        
        
    <h3>
        Redesign Goals:
    </h3>
     <p>
        The time spent on our website will be about 40% reading experience and 60% searching/browsing experience. The entire visit will be around 15 minutes. Our website will be designed for readers to finish exploring in one sitting because all of the information on the different pages relates to each other. The home page will have clickable links to the 3 article pages; links will be the main “calls to action” on the homepage. On the individual article pages, one of the calls to action will be. 
    </p>     
    <p>
        Based on the content of this website, a 20-35 year old, journalist would be interested in our website. The NeimanLab predictions are specific to the changes in digital media and journalism, which is why mainly journalists and people in related fields would be interested in these articles. Our reader’s personality is someone who’s very curious, eager to learn and likes to have lengthy discussions. Based on the visual design of our website, our reader is a millennial, who is tech-savvy and actively pays attention to design. Our reader is very clean and minimal.

    <h3>
        Walkthrough of Website         
    </h3>
    <p>
        Our website’s landing page is the first demonstration of our simpler design decisions for our redesigned site. We decided to use grey as the background color because it felt very directive when paired with our font and ‘See Predictions’ button.
        
    </p>    
     
    <p>    
        The ‘See Predictions’ button takes you to a slideshow where you can browse through photos that link to each of the articles that are on our site.
        
        
        Clicking on the photos in the slideshow will take you to the separate article pages, which are linked in the photos. Each individual article features a photo of the person sharing their prediction, as well as a brief interview where they discuss their predictions. The article pages also include a button at the top left of the page to indicate that you can click back to the main page.
    </p>

        
    <h3>Roles and Process: </h3>
    <p>
        We found it very helpful to break down what needed to be done for the site into specific roles for each person; we based these roles on the individual strengths of each person in our group. Mike is very strong at coding and took the lead as the main Coder for our website, because that’s the role he felt most comfortable doing. Both Ashley and myself (Daria) are very comfortable making design decisions, and decided on working as Co-Designers. I also worked as a Project Manager to help our group stay on track with our timeline and workflow. Ashley also worked as a UX Designer to focus on the user experience and accessibility of our site.
    </p>

    <h3> Project Takeaways:</h3>
    <p>
        Working on this site presented many helpful tools for guiding future work; there were many high points, as well as challenges. Thinking through the design process and analyzing ways to make it better was very helpful in sharpening our editorial skills. We also had to make difficult decisions about copy and related topics. It was a great experience to work with others on making overall design choices for the redesign of the website. The workflow of the project was made a bit easier because we were each allowed to exercise our strengths to complete the assignment.
