            <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sageworks/2017/04/09/the-10-fastest-growing-industries-in-the-u-s/#3b60cb941ef2">jobs</a> are ranked first among the fastest growing industries in the U.S. Because of this rapid growth and the
            widespread influence technology and media has over society, it seems simply just that the people working in these
            fields represent diversely the communities they directly effect.</p>

    <section class="article-body">
        <p>For the past decade the gender gap in tech has been analyzed, researched, and rallied upon to discover and encourage
            a stronger female presence in the tech space. Activists and researchers each have varying reasons for the potential
            issue, and new data is constantly leading to new discoveries. There are believers in the pipeline problem, some
            who see it as an economic issue, an educational issue, and others as h3 cultural issue. </p>
        <h2>Where We Are Today</h2>
        <p>Everyone knows the stories of Mark Zuckerberg and Steve Jobs, known as chief innovators and the faces of technology
            itself. This may ring true, I don’t write to downplay their accomplishments that make up modern day technology,
            but to highlight the history of females in computing—both in present and in past—that seems to have been erased.
            It’s because of women like Grace Hopper who led COBOL language still used today, Ada Lovelace who theorized the
            method for ‘looping’ in computing, and many others that this field is allowed the bright future it has today,
            and because of marketing and media that their story has been buried.</p>
        <h2>The Numbers</h2>
        <div class="image-container">
            <div class="image-item md js-wit"></div>
        </div>
        <p class="caption">% Of Women Majors by field, over time</p>
        <p>As you can see from this graph produced by NPR, for decades the number of women studying computer science was growing
            faster than the number of men. However a decline begins in 1984, and continues to decrease yearly. Currently,
            according to The Office of The Chief Economist’s Women In STEM: 2017 Update, only 25% of women currently attain
            a job in a STEM related field of work… With tech being one of the fastest growing industries in the country it’s
            important to encourage the opportunity for tech to be a career path for girls.
        </p>

        <h2>What Others Are Doing</h2>
        <p>In attempts to bridge this gap Girls Who Code—a company that introduces youth girls to the tech world in a summer
            immersion program—reports that about 74% of young girls express an interest in STEM fields and computer science
            which, from then to college drops to only 18 percent of undergraduate computer science degrees held by women.</p>
        <p>
            <a href="https://girlswhocode.com/">Girls Who Code</a> along with other organizations like
            <a href="https://www.instagram.com/shegeeksout/">Tech Ladies</a>, and
            <a href="https://www.instagram.com/shegeeksout/">She Geeks Out</a> are among those who support and encourage a stronger female presence in the workplace. The
            intention being: when there’s little to no female support in certain companies, women can find a community here
            with these empowering organizations.
        </p>

        <h2>What We're Doing</h2>

        </div>
        <p>In the recent wave of feminism, women in tech have not only cried about about the clear gender gap, but also of the
            <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/30/technology/women-entrepreneurs-speak-out-sexual-harassment.html">harassment</a> issues in the workplace. As this is becoming a heightened issue in the media riding on the same
            wavelength as #METOO, women in tech will begin to do all they can to rise up and become leading voices in tech
            companies by the simple act of sharing stories and teaching one another skills to survive and to thrive. This
            is why we’ve created Women of Tech, your go to guide for women making it in tech.</p>
        <p>Women of Tech is an online repository of women in tech who are breaking the glass computer screen and inspiring myself
            and my partner Joshua Shao… (and hopefully will inspire you too!) As students at both The New School and RISD
            we’ve collaborated on this project to bring you our curated list of creative computers, software stars, and overall
            rockstar ‘wo-grammers’ to sift through, explore, and inspire anyone wanting to be in this field. </p>
