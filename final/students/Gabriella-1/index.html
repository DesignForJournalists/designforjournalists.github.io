     <p><span>I</span>n an increasingly digital age, it’s clear that the value of books is decreasing. In order to get people back into caring about books, we must blend the two. Once the user fills out a short questionnaire about their literature familiarity and general interests, we will provide the user with an interactive digital experience in conjunction with an interactive real life experience in order to get the user to experience new areas and new literature in Manhattan that they otherwise would not see.


</p> <br /><p> The user will be provided with an introduction email and a code to then input into an app, which will eventually fill in as a full map. The app will then show them an address of a bookstore in Manhattan where they can go find their first clue.
<br></br>

<br></br>
  Once they locate the clue, which will be tucked inside of a book that may or may not have been recommended for them based on their interests (and encouraged to purchase), then they can input a code from that clue that will direct them to the next book store. This will repeat 5 times until they have a fully completed map, 6 tiles, on their phone.
</p> <br />

The address/clue for the last location will be for an event—a literature related one, like The Moth, a poetry slam, or a book reading with a famous author.

<span>T</span>here wil be an example tutorial/behind the scenes video, similar to this one, on the home page that guides the user and lets them see how we put the experience together on our end.
