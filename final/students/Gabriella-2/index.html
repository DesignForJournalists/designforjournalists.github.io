    <h1><i>Letter From The Editor</i></h1>
    <p>Dear readers,</p>
    <br></br>

As a modern day twenty-something woman, it’s increasingly hard to find a place online where you can express yourself to a community of other twenty-something women. But now there is a place you can do that. This is for you. This is <i>21 Problems.</i>
<br></br>
Think of it as a mixture between a more mature <i>Rookie, i-D, NYLON Magazine,</i> and your own personal blog. <i>21 Problems</i> is here for expression, good or bad. It’s for confession, good or bad. It’s for support, community, and as a safe space to bond with your fellow women.
<br></br>
Updating the website daily, but following a monthly theme, we will be covering everything from beauty tips to style tips, from poetry writing to fiction writing, and from short docu-series to photo series. We know we don’t all look alike and don’t all have the same interests, so we’re here to represent, you, the modern day twenty-something.
<br></br>
We will also offer a yearly magazine for purchase, which will include the year’s best content as well as exclusive content.
<br></br>
Welcome to the club.
<br></br>
Xxoo,
<br></br>
Gabriella
