    <p> Designed to meet the needs of its urban-dwelling, working, young-adult audience, each story is broken up into 25 minute long “Chapters,” perfect for enjoying on a morning commute. Each morning, a new chapter is released and automatically downloaded while the app is connected to wifi so the listening experience is not interrupted by subway tunnels. Noted tells the stories no one else does, revealing rich histories behind seemingly mundane topics. Each segment of the historical content is cut into clear and relevant chapters and ordered chronologically making them easier to digest. These bite-sized bits of knowledge are designed to keep short attention spanned millennials engaged. Just click the photo displayed above the podcast player to navigate to the corresponding flipbook gallery. </p> </div>

    <h1>immerse</h1>
  <p> Each podcast episode is accompanied by a flipbook gallery of photos that bring the story to life. Galleries are a collection of photos that are relevant to the audio content of the podcast chapter. In this particular history, they depict the book covers of the book titles, portraits of authors and photography of coinciding and influential events, therefore providing historical context. One photo fills the screen at a time, allowing viewers swipe to the left to see the next photo. To read additional information, just swipe up. The flip book is meant to act as both a reinforcement of the audio content and main story line, but also to give addition pieces of information. For example, a name-drop or reference is untangled from the story, and given its own separate highlight in a way complicates and strengthens the core content.</p></div>
