<div class="text"> <h1>Welcome Change-Makers!</h1>
<p>I am pleased to introduce you to one world, one love, a global community-run publication based on social justice and intercultural idea exchange. We aim to create an interactive cross-section between international news, politics, storytelling and change-maker forums. In this ever-changing and ever-globalizing world, we believe young people should have a singular resource that informs, inspires, immerses and impacts.</p>

<p><strong>Inform</strong> yourself by staying up to date on international and regional news unfiltered by mainstream media. Independent new sources provide up-to-the-minute breaking news free of corporate bias and run along-side weekly opinion and analysis pieces by selected contributors.</p>

<p><strong>Inspire</strong> yourself by reading stories, listening to podcasts, and viewing media of all sorts created by fellow change-makers across the world. Each week, we highlight a different podcast and feature a new inspiring person. Each day our “On-this-day” page will give you a historical glimpse into what change-making events occurred on that day.</p>

<p><strong>Immerse</strong> yourself in what is happening around you. Our change-maker toolkit helps you reach out to local organizations and clubs, public lectures, protests, rallies, job opportunities and much more. Want to immerse yourself in politics? “Yea or Nay” keeps you updated on what’s going on on capitol hill.</p>

<p><strong>Impact</strong> the change-maker community by engaging in our web community yourself. Have an opinion or angle on something that's going on? We encourage our readers to think critically and reflect, then send your work our way! Are you an artist? Design our home page header! It is updated daily by reader-submitted art, just show us what the globe looks like to you!</p></div>
