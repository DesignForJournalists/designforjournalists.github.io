    <div class="title">On the beach: a critical guide to surf and sand {presentation}</div>
    
    <div class="text">Choosing a small portion of NYC summer survival guide was extremely intentional. I wanted to capture the beaches written about, especially since summer in NYC is treachorous, to give the sense of old luxury. By choosing to give off a more editorial feel of the article, I am hoping to give the idea of elegance when it comes to NYC beaches, who says you can't pertend you're in Greece. 
    <br>
    I am serializing it by putting up sections week by week. Telling followers to join in groups to go to the beach posted live on the website. Once all the beaches and their subsequent information have been posted, it will stay live, so that it is always accessible to our reader. This will hopefully allow and help New Yorkers to explore new and fun places on there summer Fridays
