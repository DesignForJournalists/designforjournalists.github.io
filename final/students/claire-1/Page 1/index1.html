      <h1><a id="ob">Orchard Beach</a></h1>
    Orchard Beach, part of New York's largest park-2,118-acre Pelham Bay Park in the Bronx—has swimming in Long Island Sound and, officially, the cleanest air in the city. Take the No. 6 Lexington Avenue-Pelham Bay train to Pelham Bay Park; special No. 12 buses run from the subway to Orchard Beach in the summer. At other times the No. 12 City Island-Fordham bus will drop you off a short walk from the beach.

        <h1><a id="ci">Coney Island</a></h1>
    Of the two Brooklyn beaches, Coney Island Beach is best avoided. Apartment buildings and amusement park rides loom high; it is hard to avoid the piles of refuse on the beach, and the water is unappetizing. To get there, if you insist, take the IND (F or D train) or BMT —the N, B, QB (weekends only) or QJ (weekdays) train to Stillwell Avenue. 
        <br><br>
        <h1><a id="mb">Manhattan Beach</a></h1>
    Farther along the same shore, but entirely different, is small Manhattan Beach, screened by a semicircle of plane trees which shade playing fields, playgrounds and six clay tennis courts (Parks Department tennis permit required). Take the D train to Sheepshead Bay and the No. 1 Manhattan Beach bus to the beach. Better yet, walk there from the subway over the foot-bridge which spans Sheepshead Bay with its fleet of fishing boats and enjoy the gardens and tree-lined streets of the neighborhood. Manhattan Beach looks across Jamaica Bay to the 10-mile Rockaway Peninsula in Queens which encompasses an array of beaches. 
        <br><br>
        <h1><a id="rb">Rockaway Beach</a></h1>
    Rockaway Beach stretches seven and a half miles from Beach Third Street to Beach 149th Street, and too much of it is depressingly like Coney Island without its pop glamour. Barracks-like rows of tiny gray bungalows and vast apartment complexes line the beach; there is an amusement park at Beach 98th Street. Rockaway does have surf, however, and surfing is allowed between Beach Ninth and Beach 119th Street from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. Take the HH (or at certain hours the A) train to any stop between Beach 90th-Holland and Rockaway Park or between Beach 17th and Sea Girt. The best section of Rockaway is at the far western end in the pleasant and well-kept community of Neponsit. To find it, get off the Q35 bus (see below) when it turns at Beach 147th Street, and walk down the street to the beach. Riis Park has less beach but far more park than Rockaway: 236 acres span the peninsula, with ballfields, deck games, four playgrounds and an 18-hole pitch-and-putt golf course ($1 a round; $1 for clubs and balls). The low wooden jetties which divide the beach into 14 "bays" also serve as informal social divisions. Bay 1—the easternmost—is open all day for surfers; homosexuals congregate at 2 and 3, singles at 4, blacks at 5, and so on. Take the No. 3 Seventh Avenue Express to Flatbush Avenue and the Q35 bus to the park.

        <h1><a id="ft">Fort Tilden</a></h1>
    Next to Riis Park is Fort Tilden, whose beach is available exclusively to reservists and active- or retired military personnel and their dependents at $5 per person a season, with a maximum charge of $20 a family. Call Fort Hamilton, TE 6-4100, ext. 245, for more information. Controversial Breezy Point at the western end of the peninsula has 400, acres of undeveloped public beach land which can only be reached by brazil the intimidating guards and NINO' signs of the Breezy Point Cooperative, an association of the owners of 3,000 or so summer bungalows. The city originally had plans to develop Breezy Point as a park in conjunction with Park and, hopefully, Fort Tilden. No %ts it looks as if the federal government may include it in the proposed Gateway
        <br><br>
        <h1><a id="nra">National Recreation Area</a></h1>
    National Recreation Area at the entrance to New York harbor. The Army is not about to give up Fort Tilden. And the Cooperative still claims that part of the beach the city says it owns is theirs. The Staten Island beach closest to Manhattan is ugly South Beach. A busy highway, Seaside Boulevard, runs beside it; there are few trees, the water is a blackish-red, and at the north end, polluted. It's only safe to swim south of Slater Boulevard. The sole cheerful note is that the pollution boundary has been moved north, increasing the cleared area of South Beach. Take the Staten Island ferry; a No. 2 or No. 104 bus, which meets the ferry, will take you to the beach. Or take the BMT local to 95th Street in Brooklyn, then the R7 bus to the beach, a way of avoiding four miles of Staten Island weekend traffic. </div>
