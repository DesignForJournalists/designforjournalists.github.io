        <h1><a id="gkp">Great Kills Park</a></h1>
Farther down the shore, off Hylan Boulevard, is Great Kills Park, the best of the Staten Island beaches and part of the Gateway proposal. The result of a landfill project completed years ago, it is now a two-mile-long expanse of swamp grass harboring pheasants and other wild fowl. Beyond the last parking lot, an incredibly rutted dirt road takes you out on a spit of land which shelters Great Kills Harbor with its yacht clubs, lively sailboats and mul-titudes of fishermen.

        <h1><a id="wpp">Wolfe's Pond Park</a></h1>
   There are threats that a sports stadium and a shore parkway are to be built in the park, but so far the place retains the gusty wild-ness essential to a good beach. You can take the No. 103 bus from the ferry or the R7 to Staats Circle, and then the No. 103 bus to get there, but I think a car is preferable. Wolfe's Pond Park, at Holton and Cornelia Avenues, near the southern end of Staten Island, is small, woodsy, with a narrow strip of beach and too many picnic tables, but it is the least crowded of the Staten Island beaches. Take the No. 103 bus, or go by car. 
        <br><br>
        <h1><a id="sb">Sheepshead Bay</a></h1>
    Farther along the same shore, but entirely different, is small Manhattan Beach, screened by a semicircle of plane trees which shade playing fields, playgrounds and six clay tennis courts (Parks Department tennis permit required). Take the D train to Sheepshead Bay and the No. 1 Manhattan Beach bus to the beach. Better yet, walk there from the subway over the foot-bridge which spans Sheepshead Bay with its fleet of fishing boats and enjoy the gardens and tree-lined streets of the neighborhood. Manhattan Beach looks across Jamaica Bay to the 10-mile Rockaway Peninsula in Queens which encompasses an array of beaches.

        <h1><a id="jb">Jones Beach</a></h1>
    If you have a car and the time, you can of course reach much better beaches. I made it to the incomparable Jones Beach in an hour from uptown Manhattan on a sunny Thursday afternoon; I've also spent two hours in a traffic jam of cars all apparently bound for Jones Beach one warm Saturday. Jones Beach State Park has facilities too numerous to detail—deck games, paddle tennis, Ping Pong, roller skating, a swimming pool which is lit up at night, dancing, and a theatre. If you're driving, take the Northern or Southern sions are followed by endless colonies of small cottages a handspan apart. There are two exceptions.

        <h1><a id="shsp">Sandy Hook State Park</a></h1>
    Sandy Hook State Park, an hour and a half's drive from New York, is a long spit of land between Sandy Hook Bay and the Atlantic. Due to be part of the Gate­way park, it includes a small nature study center with specimens of park flora and fauna, and a holly forest with trees up to 300 years old, the kind of low forest that once cloaked many of our beaches. Flocks of migratory birds rest there. Sandy Hook is also threatened by erosion, pollution, and the Army's dredging plans for the northern end of the spit. The entrance fee is 50 cents, plus 25 cents for each person over 12. It's open from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. About 25 miles down the coast, and two hours' drive or more (as far as you'd want to go in a day), is Island Beach State Park. Ten miles long, the park is one of the few remaining

        <h1><a id="maw">Meadowbrook And Wantagh</a></h1>
   State Parkway to Meadowbrook and Wantagh State Parkways; the 75-cent entrance toll includes parking. Buses for Jones Beach leave the Port Authority Bus Terminal daily, as soon as full, between 9 and 9:30 a.m. On Sundays and holidays, they leave between 9 and 10 a.m. The return trip leaves the beach at 5. Weekend service began Memorial Day weekend; the fare is $1.50 each way for adults, $1 for children 5 to 11; under 5, free. Buses to the beach also meet L.I.R.R. trains at Freeport and Wantagh stations.
