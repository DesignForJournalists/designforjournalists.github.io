        <h1><a id="fi">Fire Island</a></h1>
      Forty-nine miles from New York City, and an hour and a half's drive under ideal conditions, is Robert Moses State Park at the western tip of Fire Island. Like Jones Beach it offers an endless expanse of clean white sand, and you can always walk away from the crowds. There is an 18-hole pitch-and-putt golf course at the western end of the beach; $1 a round, and clubs are provided. To get there, take exit 40 (easy to miss) off the Southern State Parkway to the Robert Moses Causeway (75-cent round-trip toll). Buses to the beach meet trains at the Babylon L.I.R.R. station.

        <h1><a id="gb">Gilgo Beach</a></h1>
    Neither Jones Beach nor Robert Moses State Park allows surfing; surfers go to Gilgo Beach, which lies between them. The town of Babylon operates a small parking lot there; non-residents have to pay $1.50 a day; $3 a day on weekends.For the most part, the much-touted Jersey shore offers the depressing evidence of man's insatiable appetite to buy up, fence in, build upon, and destroy the seashore. Town succeeds town, differentiated only by zoning laws—endless blocks of Jersey Tuscan mansions are followed by endless colonies of small cottages a handspan apart.
        <br><br>
        <h1><a id="shb">Sandy Hook Bay</a></h1>
   There are two exceptions. Sandy Hook State Park, an hour and a half's drive from New York, is a long spit of land between Sandy Hook Bay and the Atlantic. Due to be part of the Gateway park, it includes a small nature study center with specimens of park flora and fauna, and a holly forest with trees up to 300 years old, the kind of low forest that once cloaked many of our beaches. Flocks of migratory birds rest there. Sandy Hook is also threatened by erosion, pollution, and the Army's dredging plans for the northern end of the spit. The entrance fee is 50 cents, plus 25 cents for each person over 12. It's open from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.
        <br><br>
        <h1><a id="ibsp">Island Beach State Park</a></h1>
   About 25 miles down the coast, and two hours' drive or more (as far as you'd want to go in a day), is Island Beach State Park. Ten miles long, the park is one of the few remaining natural state. Only a small portion of the beach is available for swimming; much of it is a wildlife sanctuary and botanical preserve. Free one-hour nature tours are given daily at 2 p.m. Hours and fees are the same as at Sandy Hook.Island Beach almost became an exclusive and expensive development of summer homes. When I was there in May, the beach plum was in bloom and I saw ospreys nesting. A blessing on state parks.
        <br><br>
        <h1><a id="bp">Breezy Point</a></h1>
   All the beaches mentioned except Breezy Point have parking: 25 cents a day at Robert Moses and Riis Parks, 75 cents at the other city parks and no ad­ditional charge elsewhere. Without ex­ception, the lots fill up early-10 a.m. on a good day. In the case of the state parks, when the parking fields are full, you simply don't get to the beach, since nothing is ever available nearby.
        <br><br>
        <h1><a id="wp">Wolfe Pond</a></h1>
   Most beaches have bathhouses with showers and lockers available. Lockers at the city parks are usually 30 cents for adults, 15 cents for children. Park fees are slightly higher.
Umbrellas and beach chairs are available everywhere but Wolfe's Pond: 75 cents and a $3 deposit at the city beaches; 79 cents and $1.25 deposit at Jones Beach and Robert Moses State Park; $1.25 for umbrellas, $1 for chairs or beach blankets at Sandy Hook and Island Beach, with a $5 deposit. Jones Beach and Robert Moses State Park do not allow dogs on the beach or walks. At Island Beach, pets are not allowed in the swimming area and must be on a leash at all times. No alcoholic beverages are allowed in any of the state parks. </div>
