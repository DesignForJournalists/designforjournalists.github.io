<p class="opening">
  Tired of being alerted of who just got murdered? Fed up with how the economy is getting worse? Exausted with the never ending cycle of crime stats, exaggerated storm warnings, blah blah blah. The news can be dreary and down right fear inducing. So we here at Good News Today exist to warp the news into a 360 form. Giving you what would happen if the bad were the good everyday.</p>

  <p class="question">
    Whose this site for?
  </p>

<p class="Answer">
  Anyone who can't sleep after they watch the news.</p>
  <p class="answer"> People who always wish the next top story will involve unicorns.</p>
  <p class="answer">Anyone who at ten o'clock knows where their children are.</P>

    <p class="question">
      Here are a few examples of what's to come...</p>
<p class="answer">
  Donald Trump drops out of race and donates his wealth to single soup kitchen.</p>
  <p class="answer">
    Cuba Leader to eliminate accidental fires all together after hugging Obama.</p>
    <p class="answer">
      Heart disease revealed to be a hoax all along.</P>

      <p class="closing">
        So why is this important? Because the people deserve to live in a world where GOOD happens; where it's served daily in obnoxious dosages until the people miss the bad....even if this is all delsusional written word </p>
