<p class="description">For this project, we were asked to re-design and edit an article to create a unique editorial experience. I chose the Modern Mechanix article, "The Steam Car is Coming Back," that argues the many advantages of the steam car. Since the piece argues a comeback, I imagined the article as something similar to a 2016 piece of sponsored content, paired with a social media campaign.</p>

<p>To begin, I would approach a sponsor or two, likely some steam car manufacturers who have a steak in their comeback. I would ask them to sponsor a social media campaign that we would use to draw people to the piece.</p>
    
<p>In order for a product to have a comeback, a younger generation needs to find the product compelling. We will use young, trendy social media influencers so we can target their followers and market to their audience.</p>
    
<p>The social media campaign would enlist 10-20 influencers to post images of themselves with their steam cars to their Instagram and Twitter accounts, spread out over the course of two weeks. They will not be required to use any hashtags or post any branded text to accompany the images that way the posts appear as authentic as possible.</p>

<p>After all the posts are live, Modern Mechanix will publish their article about the steam car’s comeback by commenting on the trend they watched happen on social media. They will interview 2-3 of the people who posted about why they are choosing the steam car.</p>

<p>Instead of using the long-form format of the old piece, this reimagined version will be short and concise. It will feature not only the voice of the author, but also the voices of the influencers. It will get rid of the black and white images and diagrams, and instead showcase screen grabs of the influencers’ social media posts and maybe some video content.</p>

<p>When the piece is published, the same influencers who were hired to post images before will promote the article on their social media pages. The steam car manufacturers will also promote the article and the posts about the article by the influencers.</p>

<p>This method will benefit the influencers because they not only will be paid for their posts, but will also have their images posted on big car manufacturers’ social media drawing more fans to their pages. It will benefit Modern Mechanix because it will draw a new audience to their site and their social media pages, as well as take the burden of financing the post away. And it will benefit steam car manufacturers because they will have the cosign of the influencers and the article urging consumers to buy their product.</p>
