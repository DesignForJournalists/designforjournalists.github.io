<h3>Letter from the Editor</h3>

<p>212 is an online magazine aimed at readers who are interested in taking time to read long-form articles about contemporary New York culture. One or two pieces will come out per month, all written by New York-based writers with original photography by New York-based photographers. At the end of the year, all the pieces will be released in a print magazine that will be available for sale around the holidays. 212 will give readers all over the world a more authentic look at how young people work, play, and move in the city. Writers will discuss music, art, style, and more. In the age of the internet, very few people write about youth culture in a way that keeps young peopleâ€™s attention: less content less often, but consistenly high quality. People will come to our site to spend time like they would browzing a gallery or museum. Pieces will be long form, but will also be photo-heavy with ways to interact throughout the piece. By only releasing a few things each month, New York readers will come to read about what other young New Yorkers are doing, and people all over the world will come to read about the cool cultural movements that are happening in New York.</p>
