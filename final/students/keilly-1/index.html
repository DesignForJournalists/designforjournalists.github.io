             “At 4pm,  I’m going to fall and will need a bandaid”, said no one ever.

    The idea of a first aid kit, is that it comes in handy when you least expect it. You don’t plan on using it, you just use it. The NYC First Aid Kit for Summer 2016, is an app that intends to function in that same way.  it has a little bit of everything, events, kids activities, concerts, nearest beach, the article of the week and music. 

Just like a kit, this app is meant for everyone. Bandaids don’t discriminate, and neighter does this app. While we offer a variety of party locations, we also offer the best fishing spots for the week.

        <p> Pulling on the our original theme of first aid, it also offers a list of nearest hospitals and call 911, for those moments when its an actual emergency. This section will also provide images on how to help someone choking or perform CPR. After all, it is a digital first aid kit.</p>

    <div class="lastwords"> <b>NYC First Aid Kit for Summer 2016</b> is an app inspired by the article <i>Summer Survival Kit for Recession Casualties and Inflation Victims</i> published by The New Yorker in 1970. It was created by Keilly Fernandez as her final project for Design for Jorunalist: From Typography to Interaction, a class held at The New School University and taught by Dylan Greif. Images used on the app wireframe, such as parks, beaches, or Beyonce were not taken or owned by Keilly Fernandez.</div>
