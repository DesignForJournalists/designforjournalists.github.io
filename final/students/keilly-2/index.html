    <h1> Breaking through the Ask Gap</h1>

It is time to break the silence. Very soon, coming to you will be a new exclusive platform where we, the women of New York City, WIll shine light on the issues we encounter in the workplace. This is no longer just about the wage gap. This is about sending the only woman in the room to get you copies, even when she is the vice president. This is about being told we are expected less of by men, and more of by the women at the top who for some reason or another, seem to think we are their competition.</p>  <p>We need to talk about this now because it doesnâ€™t make sense to start the conversation tomorrow. Every week a new story will be published on this platform, and soon we will be a thousand stories but under one voice. If you would like to e a part of this project, please contact example@gmail.com. </p>
