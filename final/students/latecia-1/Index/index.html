  <h1>New York's Summer Survival Kit via The Apple Watch</h1>
  <h2>By Latecia Joiner </h2>
  <p>For my project I wanted to create a more mobilized version of New York's Summer Survival Kit issue. The specific crowd
    that I would like to target are 18-37 year olds who live in New York City and are constantly traveling to work and
    school. These individuals barely have time to look up events because they're always on the go. I would like for my
    project to contain a sense of conviency for fellow users.</p>
  <p>After reading the issue, I decided that I wanted to create an app on the apple watch because it's the most convient
     gadget on the market (even more than a persons phone). New York's article contained various activities such as the
     beach and fishing spots that are acessible in the summer. The probelm that I have with this article is that these
      events are open to everyone and may not be considered a hangout spot for (18-24 year olds), also this article is not
      available to individuals who live a life of non stop traveling.</p>
  <p>Take me for example, I wouldn't have the time to go to a news stand and purchase this article because I could be using
     that time for something more related to school and work. Also another element is that with events that have been
     distributed via print magazines may get canceled due many conundrums. By my apple watch prototype, any events that have
      been canceled at the last minute will show up instantly on the device. Think of it this way, if a potential user
      decides that they would like to find an upcoming event in a spur of the moment situation then this app would be their
      best go to method. The way that the app finds locations of where these events are is based on the current location
      that the user is physically in. Want to learn more about this app? Scroll down!</p>

  <h1>I Made A Prototype! </h1>
  <p> I created a prototype of how the app would actually function and look on the apple watch. The format that I created this
experiment through was a website called invision. The process of creating this application was very fun because I was
allowed to use my creativity and retransform this basic article into something much larger. Every screen that
 is shown on the template was created through Adobe InDesign. I designed each screen according to the approximate specics
 of the apple watch. After, I saved the file as a pdf and uploaded it onto the invision site in the matter of seconds.  </p>
