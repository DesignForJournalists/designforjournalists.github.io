<h1>A book by any other name...</h1>

<h2>In the beginning was the word.</h2>

<p>Since the invention of the printing press in 1440 the publication of books has been made infinitely easy. Reproduction of printed works was skyhigh and it no longer remained in the hands of the elite.</p>

<p>Instead, books belonged to everyone. Titles, however, were a different thing, something that came attached with the book, but not part of it as a whole. Book titles have their own unique history that would at times intertwine with the life of a book. All across english classes in high schools there is always a question that gets asked when analyzing a book. And it always has to do with the meaning of the title.</p>

<p>What does the title mean?</p>
<p>What does it add to the larger context of the story?</p>
<p>Would you have given the book another name?</p>

<p>Those questions are always fun to speculate, even outside of high school classrooms. There is so much to learn about how titles came about and their larger impact in book publishing history. And so we take you on an adventure. In the same way that books do.</p>


<h2>The search:</h2>

    <p>To learn more about books and their titles, we will send you on a quest of sorts. At select locations within New York City there will be posters of title pages of books we have chosen to display. In finding it you will have the chance to <a href="file:///Users/odalisgarcia/Desktop/final/timeline.html">learn and view the ways in which titles have changed through the centuries.</a></p>

<p>We also want you to have an immersive experience with the area you are in and with the book, so we have made it possible for you to buy or acquire the book from your device.</p>

<p>So take a break, grab a seat, and smell the roses...</p>

<h2>The books:</h2>

<p>We have chosen five books as a starting point in our scavenger hunt of sorts. They are:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Picture of Dorian Gray</li>
<li>Oliver Twist</li>
<li>A Midsummer Night's Dream</li>
<li>The Hunchback of Notre Dame</li>
<li>Pride and Prejudice</li>
</ul>
