<div class="title">Fabuloso!</div>

<h2>Bienvenidos!</h2>


<p>As of 2014 there are 55 million latinos living in the United States.</p>
<p>Representation of that fact is hard to find in mainstream media. More importantly, positive representation. As a young person it can be hard to see yourself and people like you in a positive light, or even be affirmed and acknowledged.</p>

<p>Out of this, 'Fabuloso!' was born.</p>

<p>'Fabuloso!' will be an online and monthly-print publication that will be fueled by the passions, interests, and creativity of young latinxs. This is intended to be a space where they feel comfortable in submitting art, photography, and any written work (creative or journalistic) that celebrates their culture.</p>

<p>In the current state of things, and with current "political" figures mouthing off and saying things that are so ridiculous about thieves, murderers, and rapists. Young latinx people are in as much need of a space for their own creativity as anyone else. To see that there are people out there who also share their experiences. And also learn from other peoples' and other cultures' experiences.</p>


<p>'Fabuloso!' will be available online 24/7 and subscribers will receive our end-of-the-month magazine with an accumulation of both online and print-only articles.</p>
