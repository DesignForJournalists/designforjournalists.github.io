  <h1>Summer Survival Notepads</h1>
  <p class="intro">SUMMER SURVIVAL NOTEPADS are a collection of comments and information from people around New York who are taking advantage of the free and cheap events, venues and things to do in New York. These notepads serve as a memory bank. It is like a collection of journal entries from your fellow New Yorkers. </p>

  <p class="text">It may be absurdly optimistic to find signs and portents of hope for survival. Summertime block parties are only the festival side of tenant organizations, community development programs, and peace movements that have been building for years—and are finally beginning to show. Six years ago it was unimaginable that people would roam through Central Park at night—wading in the lakes, playing guitars in the trees, walking dogs on hot nights. Incredible that an entire block would organize to buy trees and hot lunches for their old people living in single rooms. Absolutely impossible to think that six executives would get together to repair one another's cars.</p>

<p class="text">It is funny, but maybe the war and the recession have brought enough of us together, out of our caves and onto the streets, with the middle class cut off from its escape routes to the beach, to retake our city—the best man-made resource in the world. If that happens, then we might even survive beyond summer and through the winter.
