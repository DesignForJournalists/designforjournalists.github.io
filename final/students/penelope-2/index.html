					<h2>How it works</h2>
          <p>The Summer Survival Notepads is a website and notebook generator that provides New Yorker's or people effected by inflation and the recession looking for something to do in one of the five boroughs of New York. </p>
          <p>The website shows postcards of places throughout New York. The postcards, once hovered over it with your mouse, show notepad entries from New Yorkers who have been to that activity/event or place and written a blurb about their experience and circumstance. This allows for people to be able to share their experiences with each other. Whatever you write in the notebook will generate to the website page where you can search and lookup different experiences at different locations. </p>
