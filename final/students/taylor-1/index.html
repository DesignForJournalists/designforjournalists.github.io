<div class="Vision">The vision of this article and the experience that it provides is valuable because it presents the opportunity for engagement and community to be created amongst not only readers, but between the reader and the content. It brings the article to life in a way that digital can’t. It is organic, rough, and adventurous— like the city the article will be experienced in and like the content of the article.

<div class="T_2">The Experience </div>

<br></br>
<br></br>

<div class="experience">
  The goal is to curate a conversation amongst readers about how physical spaces inform content. This collective experience seeks to put readers in an intentional situation that forces them to think about what they read and how it differs from place to place. Is me reading about coffee a more meaningful experience if it’s in a coffee shop versus if I read that article on the train? Is it a strange experience reading about coffee, but the design of the article doesn’t match my atmosphere? Do other readers feel the same way? Are my physical surroundings and lifestyle informing how I read, what I read, and why I read? Let’s engage with these questions…

In order to get it, readers must follow a series of clues that will be provided by the participating coffee house that the chapter will be at.

    The clue to the first chapter can be found on the Introduction page of the site. Once reaching the first coffee shop, readers can receive the first chapter, read it, (drink coffee), etc. After they are finished with their first site experience, they are given the clue to the next coffee shop. This gets repeated until all chapters are received and read and each site is visited.

  It is the hope that this experience will build community amongst readers, and give them the opportunity to meet other people who are reading things that they are interested in. It is also the hope that readers will run into each other doing this, and collectively work on solving the clues, traveling to and from coffee shops, and collecting each chapter of the article.

  The Inspiration
</div>

<br></br>

<div class="inspiration_2">
  My inspiration for the design of the article was based on modernity, elegance, simplicity, and adventure. I wanted to create the article in a way that would require the need for two physical pages that can be felt, touched, and read only if the reader and the article are “hand-in-hand”— hence the large, page-overlapping drop-caps.

  <br></br>

  My inspiration for the experience was created based on my curiosity about how physical spaces inform the content we are reading. I decided that the best way to do this was to take a simple topic and put it into different atmospheres that are connected to the content either historically, physically, or geographically.

<div class="context">
  This project was brought to you by The New School’s <strong>Design for Journalist class—Spring 2016 semester.</strong> The idea? To choose decades old article and re-design and edit it into a unique editorial experience. The source of my article content was derived from a New York Times published article called <i>The Coffee Bean Has Had An Adventurous Life</i> by Edward La Rocque Tinker on December 15, 1935.
