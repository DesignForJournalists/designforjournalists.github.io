    <p class="label">May 12, 2016</p>
    <div class="letter">
      <p>I would like to create a bi-annual publication influenced by the great tradition of art publications like Brodovitch’s PORTFOLIO and Fleur Cowles’ FLAIR magazine. Both publications were flashy and innovative and concentrated on art and design.</p>

      <p>Each issue of this magazine will be based on a different theme or subject. Each magazine will also be named based on the current theme. I will commission artists to create art and write pieces based on the specific subject.</p>

      <p>We will also explore that theme throughout history and also culturally. The magazine will exist in both printed and digital form. Both media will serve different purposes.</p>

      <p>The digital component will house film and music and interactive materials and the print version will be treated more like an art book with innovative printing techniques and experimental use of paper and stock. </p>

      <p>We will create a distinct design with the help of die-cuts and multipage foldouts as well as other graphic devices.</p>

      <p>The first issue will be based on the color BLUE. </p>
