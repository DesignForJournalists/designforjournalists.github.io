      <p>Below are conceptual wire frames for the publication I wish to start, using InDesign. The graphic direction I intend to go in is one of minimalism. I wanted the design to be almost invisible so the content would stand out so I created something so simple and clean as to be almost non existent. The ‘norm core’ of web design… This site is about content, user experience should be simple and intuitive. </p>

      <p>The publication will cover anything culturally relevant from art, music, fashion, beauty, current events and even politics. </p>

      <p>It's important to its target audience, saavy, culturally aware and diverse people because it will present a curated and succinct point of view. One that no other publication provides. </p>

      <p> By streamlining the design and making it simple to navigate and easily approachable people will feel more inclined to check the website regularly for content. Which is a huge goal as there will be daily postings.</p>

      <p>The website will be accessed through the URL but will also be smart phone enabled and will post daily updates on social media allowing users to get their content on multiple platforms.</p>
