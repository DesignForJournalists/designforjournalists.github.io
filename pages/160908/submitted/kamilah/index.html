    <p style="margin: 0px 600px 50px 5px; color: dodgerblue">Finish every day and be done with it.
“Write it on your heart
that every day is the best day in the year.
He is rich who owns the day, and no one owns the day
        who allows it to be invaded with fret and anxiety.</p>

<p><p style="margin: 0px 600px 50px 5px; color: dodgerblue">You have done what you could.
Some blunders and absurdities, no doubt crept in.
Forget them as soon as you can, tomorrow is a new day;
begin it well and serenely, with too high a spirit
        to be cumbered with your old nonsense.</p>
    

<p> <p style="margin: 0px 600px 50px 5px; color: dodgerblue">   This new day is too dear,
with its hopes and invitations,
    to waste a moment on the yesterdays.”</p>

    <p class="cat"><p style="margin: 0px 300px 50px 300px; color: darkred">“O Me! O life!... of the questions of these recurring; 
Of the endless trains of the faithless—of cities fill’d with the foolish; 
Of myself forever reproaching myself, (for who more foolish than I, and who more faithless?) 
Of eyes that vainly crave the light—of the objects mean—of the struggle ever renew’d; 
Of the poor results of all—of the plodding and sordid crowds I see around me; 
Of the empty and useless years of the rest—with the rest me intertwined; 
The question, O me! so sad, recurring—What good amid these, O me, O life? </p>

<p style="margin: 0px 300px 50px 300px; color: darkred">Answer.</p>

<p style="margin: 0px 300px 50px 300px; color: darkred">That you are here—that life exists, and identity; 
That the powerful play goes on, and you will contribute a verse.”</p>

    <p class="cat"><p style="margin: 0px 0px 50px 600px; color: darkgreen">“The sun shines not on us but in us. The rivers flow not past, but through us. Thrilling, tingling, vibrating every fiber and cell of the substance of our bodies, making them glide and sing. The trees wave and the flowers bloom in our bodies as well as our souls, and every bird song, wind song, and tremendous storm song of the rocks in the heart of the mountains is our song, our very own, and sings our love.”</p>
<p style="font-family: cursive; color: darkgreen">- John Muir, from his journals</p>
