    <h1>QUOTES</h1>
    <h4>This page contains three quotes, each formatted and styled in different ways. </h4>
    <h3>Editor: Michelle Yook</h3>
    <p class = h1> Identity </p>
    <p class = quote1> "We can spend our lives letting the world tell us who we are. Sane or insane. Saints or sex addicts. Heroes or victims. Letting history tell us how good or bad we are.<br>
        Letting our past decide our future.<br>
        Or we can decide for ourselves.<br>
        And maybe it’s our job to invent something better.<br>
        ... <br>
        ‘You know the ancient Greek girl?’ Paige says.<br>
        Who drew the outline of her lost lover? I say, yeah.<br>
        And she says, ‘You know that eventually she just forgot him and invented wallpaper.’<br>
        It’s creepy, but here we are, the Pilgrims, the crackpots of our time, trying to establish our own alternate reality. To build a world out of rocks and chaos.<br>
        What it’s going to be, I don’t know.<br>
        Even after all that rushing around, where we’ve ended up is the middle of nowhere in the middle of the night.<br>
        And maybe knowing isn’t the point.<br>
        Where we’re standing right now, in the ruins in the dark, what we build could be anything." <br>

    <p class = quote2> "I was going to die, sooner or later, whether or not I had even spoken myself. My silences had not protected me. Your silences will       not protect you.... What are the words you do not yet have? What are the tyrannies you swallow day by day and attempt to make your own, until you       will sicken and die of them, still in silence? <br>
        ...<br>
        Next time, ask: What's the worst that will happen? Then push yourself a little further than you dare. Once you start to speak, people will yell at you. They will interrupt you, put you down and suggest it's personal. And the world won't end.<br>
        And the speaking will get easier and easier... And you will find you have fallen in love with your own vision, which you may never have realized you had. And you will lose some friends and lovers, and realize you don't miss them. And new ones will find you and cherish you... And at last you'll know with surpassing certainty that only one thing is more frightening than speaking your truth. And that is not speaking.”
        -Audre Lorde

    <p class = h3> Happiness </p>
    <p class = quote3>"And now I want to tell you about my late Uncle Alex. He was my father’s kid brother, a childless graduate of Harvard who was an honest life insurance salesman in Indianapolis. He was well-read and wise. And his principal complaint about other human beings was that they so seldom noticed it when they were happy. So when we were drinking lemonade under an apple tree in the summer, say, and talking lazily about this and that, almost buzzing like honeybees, Uncle Alex would suddenly interrupt the agreeable blather to exclaim, “If this isn’t nice, I don’t know what is.” <br>

        So I do the same now, and so do my kids and grandkids. And I urge you to please notice when you are happy, and exclaim or murmur or think at some point, “If this isn’t nice, I don’t know what is.”
