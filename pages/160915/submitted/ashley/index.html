            <head><b>OPINIONS</b></head><br>
            <p1>Opinion is really the <span class="low">lowest</span> form of human knowledge. It requires no accountability, no understanding. The highest form of knowledge is empathy, for it requires us to suspend our egos and live in another's world. It requires profound purpose larger than the self kind of understanding.</p1>

            <head><b>DESIGN VS. CREATIVITY</b></head><br>
            <p2>Creativity is allowing yourself to make mistakes. Design is knowing which ones to keep.</p2>
