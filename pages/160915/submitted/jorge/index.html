    <span class="solid"><p1 align="center"><i>"<font size="34px">Inspiration</font>has something in common with a convulsion, and that every sublime thought is accompanied by a more or less violent nervous shock which has its repercussion in the very core of the brain. The man of genius has sound nerves, while those of a child are weak. With the one, Reason has taken up a considerable position; with the other, Sensibility is almost the whole being. But genius is nothing more nor less than childhood recovered at will — a childhood now equipped for self-expression with manhood’s capacities and a power of analysis which enables it to order the mass of raw material which it has involuntarily accumulated.</i></p1></span>

    <p1 align="center"> <font size="55px"> And</font> I think if I had to do it all over again what would I have done? Would I have worn a leather shirt? Would I have drank half a bottle of Hennessy and gave the rest of it to the audience? Ya'll know ya'll drank that bottle too! If I had a daughter at that time would I have went on stage and grabbed the mic from someone else's? You know, this arena tomorrow it's gonna be a completely different setup. Some concert, something like that. The stage will be gone. After that night, the stage was gone, but the effect that it had on people remained.</p1>

    <p1 align="left"><i>Our <font size="65px">aesthetic sense </font>, whether in works of art or in lives, has overfocused on the stubborn struggle toward a single goal rather than on the fluid, the protean, the improvisatory. We see achievement as purposeful and monolithic, like the sculpting of a massive tree trunk that has first to be brought from the forest and then shaped by long labor to assert the artist’s vision rather than something crafted from odds and ends, like a patchwork quilt, and lovingly used to warm different nights and bodies.</i></p1>
