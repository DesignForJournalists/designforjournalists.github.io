        <ul>
            <li>Design your “Paragraph Design for Web” project as a multi-page print article.</li>
            <li>Imagine the pages of this article living inside of a print magazine. Add a title, lede, deck, introductory body text, and any other written content to the article to make it read as a story, and not just like three random quotes.</li>
            <li>Your page dimension should be 8"w x 10"h.</li>
            <li>The design should be consistent with the design from your “Paragraph Design for Web” project.</li>
            <li>Use Fonts from Adobe Typekit.</li>
            <li>PRINT your pages (Under <strong>Setup</strong>, toggle <strong>Scale to Fit</strong>, and under <strong>Marks and Bleed</strong>, toggle <strong>Crop Marks</strong>). Bring it to class.</li>
            <li>EXPORT AS A PDF your work (in <strong>Adobe PDF (Print)</strong> format). Label the pdf your first name (ex: <strong>dylan.pdf</strong> – one word, all lowercase).</li>
            <li>UPLOAD the pdf to our shared google drive folder by 10:00AM next Thursday.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>For now: do not worry about adding graphic elements, running heads, and folios. We will get to that next.</em></p>
    
        <h1>Penpal project</h1>
        <p>Respond to your penpal with a postcard. The postcard should be made of cardstock thick paper, and be the same dimension as the one you received (8.5" x 5.5"). You can buy this paper at Blick.</p>
        <p>Additionally, take a legible photo of both sides of your postcard. Put both image files in a folder labeled firstname-penpal (e.g. <strong>dylan-penpal</strong>). UPLOAD that folder to the shared folder by 10:00AM on Thursday.</p>
    
        <h1>Reading for Next Week</h1>

        <h1>This Week’s Instagram Story</h1>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Jack</strong>: Create a story that walks through the chapter in <em>Designing the Editorial Experience</em> called “Layout.” Include: an explanation of what "layout" means, why we need it, and explain the different principles of layout, using visual examples from a different source for each one.</li>
            <li><strong>Chloe</strong>: Choose a case study from the book <em>Designing the Editorial Experience</em>. Translate the case study – what it shows and explains – into an Instagram story.</li>
        </ul>
