As a young girl attending Sunday mass, I'd watch them float down the nave in their medieval somberness the calm of salvation on the pink oval of their faces framed by tight-fitting coifs They seemed above the tedious cycle of confession, penance and absolution they supervised: of weekday dreams told to a stranger on Saturday; of Sunday sermons long as a sickroom visit, and the paranoia of God always watching youâ€“that made me hide under my blanket to read forbidden fictions.
