        <h1>Scope</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>You can work alone or collaborate with a classmate to conceive of a new kind of zine.</li>
            <li>The name of your zine is: The Newer York Times.</li>
            <li>Through subject matter, voice, tone, brand, and means of distribution, the zine should evoke a certain tone, personality, set of values, and perspective.</li>
            <li>This zine does not have to be produced. It has to be presented as a concept proposal. You will use descriptive copy and visual renderings to explain and defend your idea.</li>
            <li>
            It must include:<br>
              - approximately 500 words of copy that explains the value of your idea and how it works<br>
              - 5-10 visual renderings<br>
              - a logo and color palette<br>
            </li>
            <li>You can decide what the magazine is about. (What many things can “The Newer York Times” mean? What do you want it to be?)</li>
            <li>You won't be writing content for the zine. What's more important for this concept is designing exactly where it is distributed, exactly when, and exactly how often. In what way do you want it to activate individuals or the community? How does it affect their day, what they do, and how they communicate with one another? Imagine your magazine not beholden in any way by distribution or financial limitations.</li>
            <li>When you shape the magazine, it should implicitly or explicitly evoke: who the target audience is and why the zine worth their reading? Additionally, you should clearly be able to articulate these two things.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h1>Deliverable</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>A Medium post that proposes your idea.</li>
            <li>More details TK</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h1>Schedule</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>The Final project is due Dec 15 and no later. (We will have a crit that day, and a guest critic). </li>
        </ul>
