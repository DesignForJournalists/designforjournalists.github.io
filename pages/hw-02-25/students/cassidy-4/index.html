  <p>"Another way that you <span class="red2">love</span> your enemy is this: When the opportunity presents itself for you to defeat your enemy, that is the time which you must not do it. There will come a time, in many instances, when the person who hates you most, the person who has misused you most, the person who has gossiped about you most, the person who has spread false rumors about you most, there will come a time when you will have an opportunity to defeat that person. It might be in terms of a recommendation for a job; it might be in terms of helping that person to make some move in life. That's the time you must do it. That is the meaning of <span class="red2">love</span>. In the final analysis, <span class="red2">love</span> is not this sentimental something that we talk about. It's not merely an emotional something. <span class="red2">Love</span> is creative, understanding goodwill for all men. It is the refusal to defeat any individual. When you rise to the level of love, of its great beauty and power, you seek only to defeat evil systems. Individuals who happen to be caught up in that system, you <span class="red2">love</span>, but you seek to defeat the system."</p>
