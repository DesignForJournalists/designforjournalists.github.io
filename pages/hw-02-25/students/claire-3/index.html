  <h1>
    The Love Song<br> Of Alfred J. <br>Prufrock
  </h1>
<p>
<div class="main">
And indeed there will be time<br>
For the yellow smoke that slides along the street,<br>
Rubbing its back upon the window-panes;<br>
There will be time, there will be time<br>
To prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet;<br>
There will be time to murder and create,<br>
And time for all the works and days of hands<br>
That lift and drop a question on your plate;<br>
Time for you and time for me,<br>
And time yet for a hundred indecisions<br>
And for a hundred visions and revisions<br>
Before the taking of a toast and tea.<br>
by T.S. Elliot
