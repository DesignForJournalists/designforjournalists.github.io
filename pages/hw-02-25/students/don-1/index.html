<h1> “ So now listen here,
 I’m going to give you
 a piece of advice... </h1>


<p> If you have someone that you
think is the one don’t think:</p>

<h2>“OK LETS MAKE A DATE,</h2>
<h2>LET’S PLAN THIS,</h2>
<h2>MAKE A PARTY AND GET MARRIED.”</h2>


<p>Take that person and travel around the world.
Buy a plane ticket for the two of you to travel
around the world.</p>

<p>Go to places that are jard to go to and hard to go
off; and when you come back to JFK, and you’re
still in love with that person:</p>

<h3>GET MARRIED AT THE
AIRPORT!”</h3>
