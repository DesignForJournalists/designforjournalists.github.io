<h1> A Story From Different Seasons
</h1>

<p> "Some birds are not meant to be caged,
thatâ€™s all. Their feathers are too bright, their
songs too sweet and wild. So you let them
go, or when you open the age to feed them
they somehow fly out past you, And the part
of you that knows it was wrong to imprison
them in the first place rejoices, but still,
the place where you live is that much more
drab and empty for their departure."
