<p> “The sun is perfect
and you woke this morning.
You have enough language in your mouth
to be understood. You have a name, and someone
wants to call it. Five fingers on your hand and someone
wants to hold it. If we just start there, every beautiful thing
that has and will ever exist is possible.
If we start there, everything, for a moment,
is right in the world.”
