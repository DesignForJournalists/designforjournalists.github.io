<h2>"Originality"</h2>
<p>"Originality involves introducing
and advancing an idea that’s relatively unusual within a particular domain, and that
has the potential to improve it. Originality itself starts with creativity: generating a concept that is both novel and useful. But it doesn’t stop there. Origi-
nals are people who take the initiative to make their vis-
sions a reality. The hallmark of originality is rejecting the default and exploring whether a better option exists.
The starting point [of originality] is curiosity: pondering why the default exists in the first place. We’re driven to question defaults when we experience vuja de, the opposite of déjà vu. Déjà vuoccurs when we encounter something new, but it feels as if we’ve seen it before. Vuja de is the reverse — we face something familiar, but we see it with a fresh perspective that enables us to gain new insights into old problems. [...]
When we become curious about the dissatisfying defaults in our world, we begin to recognize that most of them have social origins: Rules
and systems were created by people. And that awareness gives us the courage to contemplate how we can change them. Although child prodigies are often rich in both talent and ambition, what holds them back from moving the world forward is that they don’t learn to be original. As they perform in Carnegie Hall, win the science Olympics, and become chess champions, something tragic happens: practice makes perfect, but it doesn’t make new. The gifted learn to
play magnificent Mozart melodies and beautiful Beethoven symphonies but never compose their own original scores."
