<h1>"Balance"</h1>
<h2>John Dewey</h2>

<p>"Life grows when a tempo- rary falling out is a transition to a more extensive balance of the energies of the organism with those of the conditions under which it lives. These biological commonplaces are something more than that; they reach to the roots of the esthetic in experience. The world is full of things that are indifferent and even hostile to life; the very processes by which life is maintained tend to throw it out of gear with its sorrounding."
</p>
<p>"Nevertheless, if life continues and if in continuing it expands, there is an overcoming of factors of opposition and conflict; there is a transforma- tion of them into differentiated aspects of a higher power and more significant life... Here in germ are balance and harmony attained through rhythm. Equilibrium comes about not mechanically and inertly but out of, and because of, tension... Changes interlock and sustain one another. Wherever there
is this coherence there is endurance."</p>
