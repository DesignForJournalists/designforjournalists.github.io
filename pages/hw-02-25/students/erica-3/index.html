     I don’t need you telling me I’m screwed up. I find more flaws within myself than you ever will. Yes, I’m a crumbling mess, but only because i’ve had to give bits and pieces of myself away. I’m left with remnants of the person I used to be. I’ve stitched those sections back together the best I could and even though my soul looks like a patchwork quilt – it’s warm.. and it’s home now.
