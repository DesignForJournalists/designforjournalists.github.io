<h1>Quote 1</h1>
<p>Do not wait.
Do not wait for	enough time or money
to accomplish what you think you have in mind.
Work with what you have
RIGHT NOW.
Do not wait for what you assume
is the appropriate stress-free
environment
in which to generate expression.
Do not wait
for maturity or insight or wisdom.
Do not wait
till you are sure that you know what you are doing.
Do not wait
until you have enough technique.
What you do now,
what you make of your present
circumstances will determine the quality and scope
of your future endeavors.
And at the same time be
patient.
â€” 	Anne Bogart
