<h1>Quote 4</h1>
<p> To offer no resistance to life is to be in a state of grace, ease, and l i g h t n e s s. This state is then no longer dependent upon things being in a certain way, good or bad.
It seems almost paradoxical, yet when your inner dependency on form is gone, the general conditions of your life, the outer forms, tend to improve greatly.
Things, people, or conditions that you thought you needed for your happiness now come to you with no struggle or      effort on your part, and you are free to   enjoy and appreciate them - while they last.
All those things, of course, will still pass away, cycles will come and go, but with dependency gone there is no fear of loss anymore. Life flows with e a s e.
â€“Eckhart Tolle
