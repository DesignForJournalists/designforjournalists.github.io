<h1>Mr. President</h1>
<p>“That’s who we are as Americans.

We are rugged individuals.

We haven’t lost that pioneering spirit that brought many of our grandparents and great-grandparents to these plains.

We ask for nothing more than the chance to blaze our own trail. And yet each of us is only here because somebody, somewhere, helped us find our path.Which brings me to one last story. It’s a story about a boy who was born more than 100 years ago in Wallace, South Dakota, about 25 miles from here. His family didn’t have much. But they were able to give him an education because he was part of that first generation of Americans to grow up in a country that believed high school should be available for everybody. After high school, that boy went on to graduate college, and then he became a teacher, and then he became a mayor, and then he became a senator. At the time Lake Area was founded, Hubert Humphrey was Vice President of the United States. But he never once forgot what made his American story possible. “The road to freedom,” he said, “here and everywhere on Earth, begins in the classroom.” The road to freedom begins in the classroom. ”
