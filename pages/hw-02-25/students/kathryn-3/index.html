<h1>BRUCE LEE</h1>

  <div class="green-box">

  <p>We can see through others only when we see through ourselves. Lack of self-awareness renders us transparent; a soul that knows itself is opaque. To become different from what we are, we must have some awareness of what we areâ€¦ Yet it is remarkable that the very people who are most self-dissatisfied and crave most for a new identity have the least self-awareness. They have turned away from an unwanted self and hence never had a good look at it. The result is that those most dissatisfied can neither dissimulate nor attain a real change of heart. They are transparent, and their unwanted qualities persist through all attempts at self-dramatization and self-transformation.</p>
