<h1>Ready To The Naked Eye</h1>

<p>Im old fashioned and I think that reading books is the most glorious pastime that humankind has yet devised. Homo Ludens dances, sings, produces meaningful gestures, strikes poses, dresses up, revels, and performs elab- orate rituals. I don’t wish to diminish the signi cance of these distractions — without them human life would pass in unimaginable monotony and, possibly, dispersion and defeat. But these are group activities, above which drifts
a more or less perceptible whiff of collective gymnastics. Homo Ludens with a book is free. At least as free as he’s ca- pable of being. He himself makes up the rules of the game, which are subject only to his own curiosity. He’s permitted to read intelligent books, from which he will bene t, as well as stupid ones, from which he may also learn some- thing. He can stop before  nishing one book, if he wishes, while starting another at the end and working his way back to the beginning. He may laugh in the wrong places or stop short at words that he’ll keep for a lifetime. And,  nally, he’s free — and no other hobby can promise this — to eavesdrop on Montaigne’s arguments or take a quick dip in the Mesozoic.”
