<h1>Idleness</h1>

<p>“The code of life in the High Middle Ages [held] that it was precisely lack of leisure, an
inability to be at leisure, that went together with idleness; that the restlessness of work-for-work’s-sake arose from nothing other than idleness. There is a
curious connection in the fact that the restlessness of a self-destructive
work-fanaticism should take its rise from the absence of a will to accomplish something. Idleness, for the older code of behavior, meant especially this: that the human being had given up on the very responsibility that comes with his dignity...
The metaphysical-theological concept of idleness means, then, that man  nally does not agree with his own existence; that behind all his energetic
activity, he is not at one with himself; that, as the Middle Ages expressed it, sadness has seized him in the face of the divine Goodness that lives within him.” </p>
