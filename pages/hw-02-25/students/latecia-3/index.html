<h1>A Love Story</h1>
<p>

“ There is something in it as of a newly conquered domain, one whose boundaries are still out be yond one’s ken, its
compass extending farther than one could walk: one senses more terrain;
senses many trails and long wanderings along paths that until now had always been shrouded in fog. And adding a
little daylight, just enough so that one can see where to take the next step, would be, from one poem to the next poem, like a real advance of footsteps, one never as yet achieved, on grounds where (in contrast to “mere” art)
illumination and action are still as one; this
domain can indeed only be made into poetry insofar and to the extent that one has conquered it and thus made it part of
a new experience.
Somewhere in this realm, deep down, all art begins again
with renewed force, arises as from its primordial origin, where it was magic formula, incantation, — a
calling forth of life in its still concealed mysteriousness, — yes, where it was at once prayer and
the most intense breaking-forth of power.
