<h1>Pride</h1>

<p>“When I think of Frida Kahlo, I think of orgullo, pride. Growing up in Mexico, I wanted to know
more about this woman with her mustache and unibrow. Who was this artist who had
unapologetically  lled her paintings with old and new symbols of Mexican cult ure in order to tell her
own story?
I wasn’t always so taken by Frida. When I was younger, I often found her paintings tortuous and
dif cult to understand. The more I learned about Frida’s life, the more her paintings began to take on new light for me.
</p>


<p>I
 finally saw that what had terriorized me about Fri- da’s images was actually her way of expressing
the things she felt, feared, and wanted.
[...] Her work was proud and unafraid and introduced
the world to a side of Mexican culture that had been hidden from view.
As a child, while learning to draw, I would often study my own re ection in the mirror and think
about Frida. Did she know how many artists she in uenced with her courage and her ability to overcome her own limitations?”</p>
