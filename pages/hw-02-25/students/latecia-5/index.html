<h1>Sontag on Literature</h1>

<p>
“Literature tells stories. Television gives in- formation.
Literature involves. It is the re-creation of human solidarity. Television (with its illu- sion of immediacy) distances —
immures us in our own indifference.
The so-called stories that we are told on television satisfy our appetite for anecdote and offer us mutually canceling models
of understanding. (This is reinforced by the practice of punctuating television narra- tives with advertising.) </p>

<p>They implicitly af-  rm the idea that all information is po- tentially relevant (or “interesting”), that all stories are endless
 — or if they do stop, it is not because they have come to an end but, rather, because they have been upstaged by a fresher or
  more lurid or
  eccentric story.
By presenting us with a limitless number of nonstopped stories, the narratives that the media relate — the consumption of which
 has so dramatically cut into the time the educated public once devoted to reading — offer a lesson in amorality and detachment
 that is antithetical to the one embodied by the enterprise of the novel. “ </p>
