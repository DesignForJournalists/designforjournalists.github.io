<h1> PLAY IT AS IT LAYS by Joan Didion </h1>

<p>SHE SAT ON THE RATTAN CHAISE in the hot October
twilight and watched BZ throw the ice cubes from his drink
one by one into the swimming pool. They had already talked
about Helene's week at La Costa and they had already talked
about an actress who had been admitted to UCLA Neuropsychiatric
with her wrists cut (the papers said exhaustion, but BZ
knew things like that, knew about people, that was why she had
called him) and now it was the hour when in all the houses all
around the pretty women were putting on perfume and enameled
bracelets and kissing the pretty children goodnight, the hour
of apparent grace and promised music, and even here in Maria's
own garden the air smelled of jasmine and the water in the pool
was 85°. The water in the pool was always 85° and it was always
clean. It came with the rent. </p>
