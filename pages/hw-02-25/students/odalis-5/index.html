  <h1>The world was wide enough...</h1>
  <p>I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory.
  Is this where it gets me, on my feet, several feet ahead of me?
  I see it coming, do I run or fire my gun or let it be?
  There is no beat, no melody
  Burr, my first friend, my enemy
  Maybe the last face I ever see.
  If I throw away my shot, is this how you’ll remember me?
  What if this bullet is my legacy?</p>

  <strong><p>Legacy.</strong> What is a legacy?
  It’s planting seeds in a garden you never get to see
  I wrote some notes at the beginning of a song someone will sing for me
  America, you great unfinished symphony, you sent for me
  You let me make a difference
  A place where even orphan immigrants
  Can leave their fingerprints and rise up
  I’m running out of time. I’m running, and my time’s up
  Wise up. Eyes up.</p>
