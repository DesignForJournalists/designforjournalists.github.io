  <h1>To be a Moral Human Being is to Pay</h1>
<p>"To tell a story is to say: this is the important story. It is to reduce the spread and simultaneity of everything to something linear, a path.

To be a moral human being is to pay, be obliged to pay, certain 			kinds of attention.

When we make moral judgments, we are not just saying that this is 	better than that. Even more fundamentally, we are saying that this is more important than that. It is to order the overwhelming spread and simultaneity of everything, at the price of ignoring or turning our backs on most of what is happening in the world.

The nature of moral judgments depends on our capacity for paying attention — a capacity that, inevitably, has its limits but whose limits can be stretched.”</p>
<p> - Susan Sontag, At the Same Time</p>
