<h1>On Art</h1>
<div style="position:absolute; top:200px; left:50px; ">
    <p>Art has always been my salvation. And my
    gods are Herman Melville, Emily Dickinson,
    Mozart.</p>

    <p>I believe in them with all my heart.
    And when Mozart is playing in my room, I
    am in conjunction with something I can’t
    explain — I don’t need to.I know that if
    there’s a purpose for life, it was for me to
    hear Mozart.Or if I walk in the woods and
    I see an animal, the purpose of my life was
    to see that animal.I can recollect it, I can
    notice it. I’m here to take note of.And that
    is beyond my ego, beyond anything that
    belongs to me, an observer, an observer.</p>
