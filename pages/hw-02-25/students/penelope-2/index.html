  <h1>INFERNO</h1>
<p>And I — my head oppressed by horror — said:</p>
<p>“Master, what is it that I hear? Who are
those people so defeated by their pain?”</p>

<p>And he to me:</p>
 <p>“This miserable way
is taken by the sorry souls of those
who lived without disgrace and without praise.
They now commingle with the coward angels,
the company of those who were not rebels
nor faithful to their God, but stood apart.
The heavens, that their beauty not be lessened,
have cast them out, nor will deep Hell receive them
—
even the wicked cannot glory in them.</p>
<p>-Dante Alighieri</p>
