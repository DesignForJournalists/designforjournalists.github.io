<h1>Letters to a Young Poet</h1>
<p>Why do you want to shut out of
your life any uneasiness, any
misery, any depression, since
after all you donâ€™t know what
work these conditions are doing
inside you?
<p>Why do you want
to persecute yourself with the
question of where all this is
coming from and where it is going?</p>
<p>Since you know, after all,
that you are in the midst of
transitions and you wished for
nothing so much as to change.</p>
<p>If there is anything unhealthy
in your reactions, just bear in
mind that sickness is the means
by which an organism frees itself
from what is alien; so one
must simply help it to be sick,
to have its whole sickness and
to break out with it, since that
is the way it gets better.</p>
