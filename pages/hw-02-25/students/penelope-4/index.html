<h1>The Stand</h1>
<p>Show me a man or a woman alone and I'll show you a saint.</p>
 <p>Give me two and they'll fall in love.</p>
  <p>Give me three and they'll invent the charming thing we call 'society'.</p>
  <p>Give me four and they'll build a pyramid.</p>
  <p>Give me five and they'll make one an outcast.</p>
  <p> Give me six and they'll reinvent prejudice.
  </p> Give me seven and in seven years they'll reinvent warfare.</p>
  <p> Man may have been made in the image of God, but human society was made in the image of His opposite number, and is always trying to get back home. </p>
<p>-Stephen King</p>
