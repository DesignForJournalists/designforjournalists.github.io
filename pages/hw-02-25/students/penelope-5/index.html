<h1>The Year of Magical Thinking</h1>
<p>Grief turns out to be a place none of us know until we reach it. We
anticipate (we know) that someone close to us could die, but we
do not look beyond the few days or weeks that immediately follow
such an imagined death. We misconstrue the nature of even those
few days or weeks. We might expect if the death is sudden to feel
shock. We do not expect this shock to be obliterative, dislocating
to both body and mind. We might expect that we will be prostrate,
inconsolable, crazy with loss. We do not expect to be literally
crazy, cool customers who believe their husband is about to return
and need his shoes.</p>
