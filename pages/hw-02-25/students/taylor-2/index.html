<p>A GREAT DEAL OF WHAT I SAY JUST LEAVES ME OPEN, I SUPPOSE, TO A VAST AMOUNT OF MISUNDERSTANDING. A GREAT DEAL OF WHAT I SAY IS BASED ON AN ASSUMPTION WHICH HOLD AND DON'T ALWAYS STATE. YOU KNOW MY FURY ABOUT PEOPLE IS BASED PRECISELY ON THE FACT THAT I CONSIDER THEM TO BE RESPONSIBLE, MORAL CREATURES WHO SO OFTEN DO NOT ACT THAT WAY. BUT I AM NOT SURPRISED WHEN THEY DO. I AM NOT THAT WRETCHED A PESSIMIST, AND I WOULDN'T SOUND THE WAY I SOUND IF I DID NOT EXPECT WHAT I EXPECT FROM HUMAN BEINGS, IF I DIDN'T HAVE SOME ULTIMATE FAITH AND LOVE, FAITH IN THEM AND LOVE FOR THEM. YOU SEE, I AM A HUMAN BEING TOO, AND I HAVE NO RIGHT TO STAND IN JUDGEMENT OF THE WORLD AS THOUGH I AM NOT A PART OF IT. WHAT I AM DEMANDING OF OTHER PEOPLE IS WHAT I AM DEMANDING OF MYSELF.</p>
