  <p> I believe I know the only cure, which is to make one's center of life inside of one's self, not selfishly or excludingly, but with a kind of unassailable serenity-- to decorate one's inner house so richly that one is content there,glad to welcome anyone who wants to come and stay,but happy all the same when one is inevitably alone.</p>
