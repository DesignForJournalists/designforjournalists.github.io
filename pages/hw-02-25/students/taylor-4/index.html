<p>“Signora, between Austria and Italy, there is a section of the Alps called the Semmering. It is an impossibly steep, very high part of the mountains. They built a train track over these Alps to connect Vienna and Venice. They built these tracks even
before there was a train in existence that could make the trip. They built it be- cause they knew some day, the train would come.”</p>
