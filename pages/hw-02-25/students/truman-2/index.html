<h1>When you fall in love...</h1>

<p1>"When you fall in <b><i>love</b></i>,</p>
<p2>it is a temporary madness.</p>
<p3>It erupts like an earthquake, and then it subsides.</p>
<p4>And when it subsides, you have to make a decision.</p>
<p5>You have to work out whether your roots are to become so entwined together that it is inconceivable that you should ever part.</p>
<p6>Because this is what love is.</p>
<p7>Love is not breathlessness, it is not excitement, it is not the desire to mate every second of the day.</p>
<p8>It is not lying awake at night imagining that he is kissing every part of your body.</p>
<p9>No...don’t blush.</p>
<p10>I am telling you some truths.
<p11>For that is just being in love; which any of us can convince ourselves we are.</p>
<p12>Love itself  is what is left over, when being in love has burned away.</p>
<p13>Doesn’t sound very exciting, does it?</p>
<p14>But it <b><i>is!</b></i>"</p>

<p>––Louis de Bernières</p>
