<h1>LIVE FOR NOW</h1>

<p><b>Do not wait.</p></b>
<p>Do not wait for enough time or</p>
<p>money to accomplish what you</p>
<p>think you have in mind. Work with</P>
<p>what you have RIGHT NOW. Do not</p>
<p>wait for what you assume is the</p>
<p>appropriate stress-free environ</p>
<p>ment in which to generate expres</p>
<p>sion. Do not wait for maturity or</p>
<p>insight or wisdom. Do not wait</p>
<p>till you are sure that you know</p>
<p>what you are doing. Do not wait</p>
<p>until you have enough technique.</p>
<p>What you do now, what you make of</p>
<p>your present circumstances will</p>
<p>determine the quality and scope</p>
<p>of your future endeavors. And at</p>
<p>the same time be patient.</p>
