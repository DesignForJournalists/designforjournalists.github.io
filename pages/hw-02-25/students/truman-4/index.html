<h1>All You Need &hearts;</h1>

<p>Something changes the moment you decide you’ve found a person you
are ready to reveal parts of  your soul to. Something stands out and
makes the moment unique. A profound multidimensional clarity resembling a piece of  carefully
gathered stardust; As if you are whispering “finally” and your eyes fill
with light and spontaneity. As if  you do not care whether your heart will
melt or crumble in the process because your brief  courage undoes your
tremendous fear of  disbelief. You live for these moments; For you are, maybe for one second or more,
sweetly forced to surrender yourself  to unconditional intimacy. A moment of  psychological reward smashing all self-imposed disciplines
founded on terror. This is all you need.</p>

<p1>––Anaïs Nin</p>
