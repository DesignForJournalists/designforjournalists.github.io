<h1>Everything Else</h1>

<p>When I was little,</p>
<p>Home meant the house I drew in crayon on white printer paper, the one that was supposed to look like the place I live in.</p>
<p>Home meant where I came back to after school every day to eat my snack and do my school work.</p>
<p>But now more and more I find that home is such a different concept.</p>
<p>Home is not where I sleep most nights, it is not the house with a family who never talks.</p>
<p>Not the place I pretend I’m fine and smile so they won’t hear the truth rattling behind my teeth.</p>
<p>Home is my best friends in the whole wide world, laughing with them so hard our stomachs hurt.</p>
<p>Home is the bookstore I go to every day after school to study and read.</p>
<p>Home is my dog with her toothless grins and wagging tail.</p>
<p>Home is all the music I listen to when I’m sad.</p>
<p>Home is drunk and camping by a lake with the people who make you feel less alone.</p>
<p>Home is not a house, it is everything else.</p>
