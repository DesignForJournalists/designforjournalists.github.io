  <div class="first-body"> Mary Kate McDevitt is a freelance illustrator and letterer—a self-proclaimed “letterstrator”—based in Philadelphia. Since becoming a full-time freelancer in 2010, she has worked with clients including Chronicle Books, Sesame Street, and Nike, as well as publications like O Magazine, and Mental Floss. She currently teaches illustration classes on Skillshare and has published several books, including her hand-lettering guidebook, Hand-Lettering Ledger.

  <div class="second-body">   <b> <i> Describe your path to what you’re doing now. </b> </i> While I wasn’t actually that good at it, I was interested in art when I was growing up. My mom bought me art supplies all of the time, and I always had a sketchbook handy, but I had lot of empty ones that I kind of gave up on. I’d start drawing a tree and think, “Oh, this tree is no good,” and I wouldn’t finish it. I took a bunch of art classes in high school, but even then I still wasn’t the best artist. I remember a girl in my class who could draw a crab perfectly, and I thought, “Ugh! I’m total rubbish.”

  <b> <i> Do you come from an artistic family? </b> </i> No. I was the only one interested in art, but I have no idea where that comes from. My mom works as an office assistant, my dad is a financial advisor, and my sister has a PhD in kinesthesiology—I’m at the total opposite end of the spectrum. Growing up, my sister was really outgoing and had a lot of hobbies and interests, so it was easy to keep her entertained. I played sports in high school, but only because I needed something to do. I wasn’t a loser or anything, (laughing) but I needed a low-key activity like art because it fit more with my personality.

  After high school, I maintained an interest in drawing and ended up studying graphic design at Tyler School of Art in Philadelphia. I wanted to focus on design because I didn’t have the kind of relationship with fine art that a lot of my friends did. With graphic design, I was really excited about all of the assignments. I became interested in design that involved a lot of illustration, texture, and hand-made elements. The teachers routinely encouraged us to work with our hands, and that really resonated with me.

  After graduating in 2007, I landed a job at a design studio right away. In order to take the job, I had to move to Lancaster, Philadelphia, a tiny town out in Amish country. The design studio was small, and we were working on things like flooring catalogs. I found myself itching to work with my hands again, so I decided to start creating art outside of work. In late 2008, I opened an Etsy shop to sell illustrations, paintings, and hand-lettered pieces I made at home. My boyfriend, Fred, is a screen printer, and we made posters in his parents’ garage. It felt good to get back into doing that type of work.</div>

  I worked at the studio for nearly two years. During that time, I made Mini Goals Chalkboards, which were little hand-painted chalkboards with hand-lettered motivational phrases. In late 2009, I sent them to a bunch of blogs, and they were featured on sites like Design*Sponge and Design Work Life.

Eventually I received an email from Chronicle Books to turn my chalkboards into a notepad. Chronicle Books was a dream client, and I wondered if I should give freelancing a try. I only had one client, but I could continue making paper goods and put more effort into my Etsy shop. Right after that, it was kind of obvious to my boss that I was losing interest in my work, so I quit my job and moved to Portland, Oregon, in 2010. That was where I decided to really give freelancing a shot.

<b> How did you go about finding work as a freelancer in a new city? </b> I’m terrible at traditional methods of self-promotion. I decided that if I kept pushing my work and telling people about it, then I’d be met with more opportunities. When I first moved to Portland, I turned to social media and said, “I’m here now. Will some art directors please email me?” (laughing) It would be easy to say that I magically started getting clients, but in reality I had been really good about posting my work online, and the way networking happens in Portland is so much friendlier than anywhere I’ve ever been. People met me and offered to email friends at publication. I slowly started receiving editorial jobs for local papers like the Portland Mercury and Willamette Week. </div>
