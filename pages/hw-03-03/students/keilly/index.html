<h2>CREATIVE DIRECTOR / DESIGNER / ENTREPRENEUR</h2>
<p>Helen Rice and Josh Nissenboim are creative directors and co-founders of the award-winning, South Carolina-based creative agency, Fuzzco. They are known for their playful, refined style, and have worked with clients like MailChimp, Google, Slack, Etsy, and Bonobos, among others. They opened up a second office in Portland, Oregon, in 2015 and recently launched Pretend Store, a digital and brick-and-mortar retail offshoot of their studio.</p>

<h2>Tell me about your path to starting Fuzzco together.</h2>

	<div class="inline-block-element set-width-40">JOSH:Everything started when Helen and I met in St. Paul, Minnesota, at a small school called Macalester College. I studied math and Helen studied studio art, but we actually met in French class. We became close very quickly and dated throughout college. 
  When we graduated in 2003, we had to figure out what we were going to do next. I moved to Madison, Wisconsin, and did a lot of different things: recorded an album, worked at a library and a liquor store, then got a job at a software company. Helen joined me in Wisconsin before she and I moved to Charleston together in August 2004.

    <div class="inline-block-element set-width-40">HELEN: Part of my senior show in college was making children’s picture books. Josh helped me with the writing and I did the illustrations, and that was kind of our first project together.At the time, we couldn’t find any jobs in Charleston that got us excited. I had been doing some design work, and Josh knew how to build websites, so we said, “Hey, let’s try to do this for people we know in town.”

<p>Tell me about your path to what you’re doing now. I’m originally from Minneapolis, Minnesota, and my awareness of design came out of growing up near the Walker Art Center and interning at Target headquarters during high school and college.</p>
<aside class="pull-quote">I spent my days poring over whatever design resources I could get my hands on.</aside>
<p>Target was important because it introduced me to working in a studio-like environment. I was surrounded by “grown-ups” who didn’t appear to work boring office jobs: they left to go for walks for inspiration or spent the day sketching, and that was fun to be around. Target also had a wonderful design library filled with annuals from the Type Directors Club and Art Directors Club, which would have been totally inaccessible to me otherwise. I spent my days poring over whatever design resources I could get my hands on.</p>
