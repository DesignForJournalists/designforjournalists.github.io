    When I was 14, two things happened. One, I started my first little business and two, I started reading my father’s copies of Forbes magazine. What I discovered is that some people were able to make a living basically doing what I do now. There are plenty of people who back into what it is they want to do, but even though I took many side roads along the way, this is exactly what I wanted to do 40 years ago. I’m thrilled that the universe lined up to let someone as easily distracted and ADD as me figure out a way to earn a fine living making a ruckus and helping people get to where they want to go.

    I said there were many distractions along the way. I ran a bunch of businesses in high school that helped me get into college and in college, I co-founded a company nonprofit that was part of Tufts, where I attended. We ended up with 400 temporary employees who were all college students. We had a snack bar, a ticket bureau, a travel agency, a concert promotion business, a birthday cake delivery business, a bagel business—we invented new businesses every ten days or so. It was a great laboratory because I had nothing to lose. I didn’t own any of the profit of the company and we did it for all the right reasons. It was fun and useful and entertaining.

    Well, you know, semantics matter a lot when you have conversations like this. I think “creativity” is better described as failing repeatedly until you get something right. I was encouraged by both my parents—my mom, who had a background in the arts, and my dad, who comes from both business and the arts—to always be putting on a show, doing an experiment, or trying something new, so I was failing from a very early age.

    In terms of creativity, the really formative thing that happened to me is that I started teaching style canoeing in Canada at a very old co-ed summer camp in a national park , which I still do every year—I’ve been doing it for 42 years. What I discovered is that if you’re in a situation where people don’t have to engage with you—because at this camp they could do anything they wanted—you have to figure out a way to attract them. The number one way I found to attract people was to help them connect with their dreams. And so, when I was 17, I started a cycle of creative ways to put on enough of a show in front of people that they would choose to engage in that to achieve their dreams. I’ve basically been doing the same thing ever since, except that there are no canoes in New York City.

  NO, THAT'S GREAT. WAS CREATIVITY APART OF YOUR CHILDHOOD?
