<div class="bodyparagraphs">  <p> <span class="questions"> TINA: Describe your path to what you’re doing now.</span></p> <p>The path to what I’m doing started with not knowing what I wanted to do. I had to make a decision about what I wanted to do as I was graduating college, and I could not figure it out. I majored in English because I couldn’t figure out how to express my love of language and writing, so I went into the most general of majors. The only possible option that appealed to me in all the careers that I could attempt was leaving the country altogether and taking more time to figure it out. (laughing)</p>
  <p>A friend of mine taught English as a second language (ESL) in Japan, and hearing her talk about it made it sound like the most magical experience I could have. Teaching ESL involved thinking about language and audience; designing curriculums on the fly; reading people; and learning how to design something that taught people how to understand grammar or conversation.</p>
  <p>I thought, “That sounds pretty close to what I want to do, and I get to travel.” I had never even been on a plane before; I hadn’t ever traveled anywhere. Growing up, we had always been a camping family.</p>
  <p> <br></p>

  <p> <span class="questions"> TINA: Where did you grow up?</span></p>
<p>Scranton, Pennsylvania. My family only went anywhere we could drive a station wagon full of camping equipment. (laughing) So flying to Asia was the first time I had ever been on a plane.</p>

<p>Since then, pursuing that feeling of not really knowing what to do, and choosing what doesn’t quite seem like the logical next step, but feels right at a gut level, is how I’ve pieced together where I am today. It’s about that combination of anxiety about going into territory where I’m totally unfamiliar, and not knowing a big chunk of it. In the case of teaching in Asia, there were so many pieces to that experience: I didn’t know the local language, I didn’t know a single person, I didn’t know the culture. Everything was different. I’ve definitely made that same decision-making process again and again and again.</p>

<p>Once I came back to America, I went back to a more traditional path. I went to graduate school, and it was there that I found a program that combined design and writing. I thought, “That’s the combination I’ve been looking for.”</p>

<p>From there, I was hired at the then design studio, Razorfish, in New York. Karen McGrane was my first professional boss: she took a chance by hiring me, and she is the reason I’m even in New York in the first place.</p>

<p>At the time I interviewed with Razorfish, I think there were only 25 people working there, and I admired every single one of them. They were all amazing people with huge CRT monitors on their desks—in those days, the bigger your computer monitor was, the better your job was. (laughing) There was something magical about looking out over that cool office of huge computers. That was the future; there was something interesting about it. Throughout the time I worked at Razorfish, I watched them grow from a small-scale agency to three thousand people in 2001. It was interesting to be a part of that process.</p>
<p> <br> </p>
<div class="pullquote2"> “The ‘Aha!’ moment is the feeling you get when you’re totally in sync with what you’re doing and there is no difference between…what you’re making and what you’re trying to communicate." </div>
<p> <span class="questions"> RYAN: What was your role there?</span> </p>
<p>I was hired as an information designer, but we quickly started thinking about what that meant: what was information design, and how did that overlap with user experience? The term information architect was being thrown around somewhere outside the building, and we thought, “That sounds about right.” It was Karen’s decision to name us “information architects” as far as I remember.</p>

<p>That was my role for a while, but I eventually started to manage a small group of people. I liked that; I liked leading and nurturing people; I enjoyed people being able to walk in and talk to me, maybe more so than thinking about buttons and design. That was an interesting realization at the time, but I’m logical about those kinds of situations.</p>
