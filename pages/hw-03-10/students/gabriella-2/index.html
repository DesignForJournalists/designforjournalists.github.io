<p>I grew up in a big family and moved around a lot. I was born in Argentina and my family moved to Colombia when I was two. When I was eight, my family moved to Vancouver, BC; we briefly returned to Colombia when I was fifteen before moving back to Vancouver where I finished high school. After that, I lived in Montreal and Boston during college before I ended up in New York. That’s my geographical path: I changed environments often and grew up in a pretty eclectic mix of cultures, which I think translates to my personality and overall approach to things.</p>

<p>I’ve always been musical, and I was very interested in music throughout my childhood. It was the one thing that was constant for me. I sang and wrote from a young age, although I was private about it. I had wanted to pursue a career in music or do something creative, but I didn’t see a realistic path to do that. All of my sisters sing, and my family loves music; I grew up being influenced by the music my parents played in our home and my sisters and I put on shows together, but nobody was a professional musician. There is definitely creativity in my family, but I had no point of reference for how to create a career out of it.</p>

<p>Once I started sharing my music and had something I was proud to put out, I narrowed my focus and said, ‘Alright, I’m doing this.’”
After high school, I studied psychology at McGill University in Montreal. While I was there, I ended up receiving a scholarship to study music full-time in Boston. That was the point when something switched in me and I decided to actively pursue a career in music.</p>

<p>While at school in Boston, I spent the entire time working on my music and writing, but I still wasn’t sharing it with many people. During my last semester, I met Luca. He was one of the first people I really bonded with there, and I shared my music with him. When I showed him the songs I had, he was really encouraging and proposed that we work on them together to make a finished product. We had both planned to move to New York after school, so after we did that, we put aside a three-week period of time to work on my music. That resulted in my first EP, Saudade, which I released in 2013.</p>

<p>Once I started sharing my music and had something I was proud to put out, I narrowed my focus and said, “Alright, I’m doing this.” People I didn’t know responded positively to it, which started to energize me. Since then, I’ve been working hard on the music and creating my own path. </p>

        <b><span class="tiger">What's the biggest risk you've taken?</span></b>
    </div>

<p> The biggest risk was initially sharing the music when I put my first song out. When you put out something that’s such a big part of you, it’s emotionally exposing. It was a huge personal and emotional risk. It could have gone so many different ways, but, thankfully, it went the best way it could have. I received a lot of positive feedback and support. Making yourself vulnerable and subjecting yourself to the judgement of others is a risk that you continue to take when you’re creative. I continue to do it daily, but that initial plunge was the biggest risk. </p>
