    <h2>Meredith Jenks is a New York-based commercial photographer whose photos range from quiet fashion portraits to energy-filled action shots. Her clients include Converse, Nike, The New Yorker, and Bloomberg Business Week, among others. When she is not shooting for work, she is probably taking iPhone photos of her dog, Mouse.</h2>

   <h3>Tell me about your path to becoming a photographer.</h3>

    <p>My dad is an oil landscape painter, so I was exposed to art while growing up. My dad took us to museums often and I did my first oil painting when I was seven years old.

    Growing up, I wanted to be a fashion designer. My grandparents both thought that was cute, so when I was 10, they got me a subscription to Vogue. So, from a young age, I was exposed to fashion and fashion photographers. I noticed Helmut Newton’s photos early on. Those were the ones that really stuck out to me in the magazine. That’s when I realized that there were people who made that imagery.</p>

  <h3>Where did you grow up?</h3>

<p>We moved around. We lived in England for a year before we moved to Sedona, Arizona, for seven years, and then ended up in Northern California. I went to middle school in Mendocino and then went to Cate School, a boarding school near Santa Barbara, which was an interesting little twist.</p>

<p>While at boarding school, I took a photo class on a whim. For most people, it was a slacker class, but I was into it. When the class started, I thought, “Well, maybe I won’t actually become a fashion designer. Maybe I’ll become involved by shooting it.” I still really loved fashion, and thought it was magical to be able to create those scenarios on the pages.</p>

<p>In my sophomore year of high school, my photo teacher sent a photo I took to an international contest. I don’t know how big the contest actually was, but I won. I got a brick of 35mm black and white film and a gift certificate to B&H. This was the first time that I had ever won anything, and it felt good. I became known around school as the photographer girl. It became part of my persona.</p>

<p>I decided that I wanted to be a photographer when I was 16. It was an easy decision because my dad was an artist. I knew there were artists out there who created for a living, so I didn’t feel pressure to do something else.</p>

<p>“It’s important to get your name and work out there, even if you feel insecure about your work and don’t think it’s ready to show. Just show your work and take jobs. It’s practice.”</p>

<h3>Did you go to college after high school?</h3>

<p>I applied to three colleges: UCLA, Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, and Art Center College of Design in Pasadena. I chose Art Center because I had already gone to boarding school and wasn’t interested in college dorm life. Art Center is like a trade school, where you don’t live on campus. It’s really intense. You only learn about your major. Since I was so young, it helped me push myself and figure out what I wanted to do. That’s the gist of why I’m doing photography. I don’t think all people need to go to art school to become a photographer, but I’m glad I did.</p>

<p>At Art Center, I shot 35mm on-camera flash back in the day before digital was around. A teacher told me I wouldn’t get work because it was unprofessional and that magazines and ad agencies don’t like the look because it appears amateurish. He was trying to be helpful, but that led me into six years of portrait lighting setups, which I was never successful at. It was frustrating. I did everything how I was supposed to and it didn’t work.</p>

<p>All along, I was still taking snapshots of friends. Two friends in particular—one who now has a design firm in LA called National Forest, and another who I was at college with—told me, “These photos are so much cooler than what you’re doing for your clients. I don’t understand why you don’t do that for work.” Meanwhile, Terry Richardson had gained attention for working with a point-and-shoot. People were out there doing it. That’s when I questioned what my college teacher had said and the work I had been making.</p>

<p>When I moved to New York almost five years ago, I decided to do what felt right. I shot a lot with flash on camera. That’s when I started getting more work—and it was work that I was excited about doing. The lesson I learned is that if I want to do something, I should do it and not fall into the trap of wondering what other people think.</p>

<h3>That’s interesting. So, you started your own business as a freelance photographer right after graduation from Art Center. Were you also working other jobs on the side? And when were you able to finally sustain yourself as a full-time photographer, which is what you do now?</h3>

<p>I definitely had other jobs when I started. I did extra work for movies and TV. I assisted a wedding photographer and acted as her personal assistant and babysitter. (laughing) I also assisted my photographer friends on jobs.</p>

<p>The good thing about Art Center, though, is they prepare you to become a commercial photographer. They teach you that you have to have a portfolio and a website, you have to do promos, you have to go to New York for meetings. They tell you exactly how to become a professional and they bring professional photographers in to speak to students. We had real-life experiences and knowledge shared with us. So I started with a good base, and I knew it would take at least five years to get started. I have other friends who thought they’d go out and be successful right away, but I didn’t ever think that. I knew it was going to be a slow process.</p>

<p>Eventually, I assisted the photographer, Jeff Lipsky, who did a shoot for Premiere—which no longer exists—and on that shoot I met Catriona Ni Aolain, the photo editor for the magazine. The next year when I went to New York, I emailed her to say I was in town. She was really nice and told me to come in. She started to give me these small $500 all-inclusive jobs, which I was overjoyed to take, and then she went to ESPN Magazine and hired me there. Someone from ESPN went to People, so I got work there. After about five years, I got more and more work and continued to do meetings in New York, which I started straight out of college, even though my portfolio wasn’t ready. People notice improvement, though. They see that you keep coming back. The first time, nobody met with me. The next time I had two meetings.</p>

<h3>Early on, it’s easy to get rejected and become discouraged. Of course your work isn’t where you want it to be because it takes time. I like that you were persistent.</h3>

<p>Yeah, that’s my personality. It’s an ego thing, too, in that I didn’t have a big ego about it. I was fine being someone’s personal assistant or doing extra work on the side. Some people aren’t okay with that. They want to shoot covers or do nothing. That’s not realistic. I knew it was a process and my dad was a good example of that. He’s been doing art his whole life, and while he hasn’t been crazy-successful, he loves doing it. For me to give up because I wasn’t getting the jobs I wanted would have been stupid. You have to keep trying.</p>
