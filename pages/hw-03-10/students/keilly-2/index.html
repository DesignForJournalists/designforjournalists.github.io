    <p class="intro">Juliette Cezzar is President of AIGA/NY and Assistant Professor and Associate Director of the BFA Communication Design program at Parsons/The New School where she was formerly Director of the BFA Communication Design and BFA Design & Technology programs from 2011–2014. She established her small studio, e.a.d., in 2005. She has worked with clients such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art, The Museum of Modern Art, the New York Times, and Eleven Madison Park. She is co-author of Designing the Editorial Experience and author-designer of Office Mayhem and Paper Pilot, Paper Captain, and Paper Astronaut. She holds an MFA in Graphic Design from Yale University and a professional degree (B. Arch) in Architecture from Virginia Tech.</p>
    
    <p class="question"><b>You have called yourself a graphic designer raised as an architect. What led you to study architecture in the first place, and how did you discover that you were actually a graphic designer?</b> </p>
    <p class="type1">Where do I even begin? I was born and raised in Queens, here in New York City, where my dad worked for the city. Right before I started fifth grade, my dad got his dream job at AT&T Bell Laboratories. We were so excited to move to New Jersey, but before a year had even passed, my whole family was miserable. AT&T had a program where they would send their engineers to teach computer science at historically black colleges and universities, and my dad opted to teach at Hampton University in Southeast Virginia. So I spent middle school and high school there. I took all these courses over the summer, and when I was near the end of it my guidance counselor said, “We don’t have anything else for you.” I graduated early and went to college at Virginia Tech when I was 16.<p class="pullquote">“Studying architecture was a miscalculation in a sense. When I was in high school, I was into math and art. I figured that math plus art equaled architecture.”</p>
    <p>Studying architecture was a miscalculation in a sense. When I was in high school, I was into math and art. I figured that math plus art equaled architecture. After five years of school, I realized that architecture is about buildings. So after I graduated college, I didn’t want to become an architect right away, but I did want to move to New York. In addition to math plus art, I was a big reader and writer, so I applied for editorial jobs. I interviewed with Cynthia Davidson at a publication called ANY, which was my favorite publication on earth at the time; it was a mix of architecture and theory. She said, “Look, we really like you, but you don’t know anything.” I didn’t. I was 21. She said, “My husband needs an archivist right now. Maybe you should go work for him.” So I worked as a publication and exhibitions coordinator for Peter Eisenman for two years. It was the best education I ever had.</p>
   
     <p> I still thought that I was only taking a break from architecture. I figured I’d go to graduate school for architecture and get back on track somehow. In the meantime, I was working on books and magazines and exhibitions and learning, in Peter’s words, “how to be a mensch.” I never made a mistake that went unnoticed, and every time I was successful with anything, he would up the ante and give me something he wasn’t sure I could do. Peter’s office was infamously behind in paychecks, though, and near the end of my time there, he offered me the opportunity to design a book. All I ever wanted was to design a book.</p>
    
    
 <p class="question"><b> You had never considered graphic design?</b> </p>
    <p> No. I thought of myself as a designer and architect, and I was doing graphic design, but I had never thought about becoming a graphic designer. That was the first time the thought crossed my mind. In 1999, I applied for digital production work at MoMA after I saw an ad in the newspaper. Ingrid Chou, the assistant director at MoMA who now teaches with us here at Parsons, also encouraged me to be a graphic designer. At the time I thought, “I like these people,” so I decided to go to graduate school and study graphic design as a way to commit. I went to Yale from 2000 to 2002 and continued freelancing the whole time, which was probably not a good idea, because all I wanted to do was work.</p>
    <p class="question"><b>Speaking of school, you’re a columnist for the Dear Design Student series on Medium.com. I loved the advice you gave about the importance of learning to accept criticism. It was interesting to read about your struggle to do that during your grad program at Yale. Tell me about that.</b></p>
    <p>Ah, that column is fun to write.
Yes, I was a terrible student throughout school. I had a technique for critiques. If I made this coffee cup (holds cup in hand), I’d go in and say, “Yeah, I made this cup, but it’s the wrong material, the color is wrong, and I should have used a different typeface.” I would go ahead and pre-critique it to make sure there was nothing left to say.
    </p>
    <p class="question"><b> But it didn’t leave you with useful information about how you could’ve made your project better. </b></p>
    <p> No, it left me with absolutely nothing. I finally learned to accept critique by working. After I graduated, I went back to work at MoMA. We had internal clients at the museum. Many times during the week, I had internal client meetings on my schedule, but all I wanted was for them to disappear. Why couldn’t they send in their specs so I could make the work? The meetings seemed like a waste of time.</p>
    <p class="pullquote">I started to think about that process—the talking that happens and what it’s for. I stopped wanting it to be so efficient. Instead of going into meetings thinking the purpose was to get people to agree to do the work the way I wanted. </p>

<p>One of the projects I was assigned to that year, though, was doing the identity and graphic design work for the two cafes (Cafe 2 and Terrace 5) and the museum’s restaurant, The Modern. They were partly owned and run by Danny Meyer’s Union Square Hospitality group. In the course of things, I got to see how they worked, and sat in on their staff training sessions. It was life-changing. They had already made a name for themselves for being service-focused, and so they were constantly asking for feedback, constantly asking how things could be better. I worked closely with Will Guider when he was just starting out, and he saw every small irritated comment as a gift, another stepping stone towards being the best.</p>
    

<p>That was the point at which things switched for me and I realized that even though those meetings were the worst part of my week, they were the best part of my clients’ week because it was the part of their job that was creative. I started to think about that process—the talking that happens and what it’s for. I stopped wanting it to be so efficient. Instead of going into meetings thinking the purpose was to get people to agree to do the work the way I wanted, I started to ask: How do I make this a better experience for them? What can I learn that I didn’t already know? What information will make this design better? That’s part of my job.</p>
