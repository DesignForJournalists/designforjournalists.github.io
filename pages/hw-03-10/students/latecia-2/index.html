<h3> <center> Interview by Tammi Heneveld, Photography by Ryan Essmaker </center> </h3>

<p>
 Rob Giampietro is a designer and writer, and serves as Creative Lead at Google Design NY.
After graduating from Yale University, he worked as a designer at Winterhouse and Pentagram before running his own studio,
Giampietro+Smith. He was Principal at Project Projects from 2010 to 2015. He has worked as a thesis advisor for the Rhode
Island School of Design MFA Graphic Design program for nearly a decade, and was the recipient of the esteemed Katherine Edwards
 Gordon Rome Prize for Design in 2014.

<h2> <center> Tell me about your path to what you’re doing now. </center> </h2>
<p>I’m originally from Minneapolis, Minnesota, and my awareness of design came out of growing up near the Walker Art Center
and interning at Target headquarters during high school and college.Target was important because it introduced me to working
in a studio-like environment.
was surrounded by “grown-ups” who didn’t appear to work boring office jobs: they left to go for walks for inspiration
or spent the day sketching, and that was fun to be around. Target also had a wonderful design library filled with annuals
from the Type Directors Club and Art Directors Club, which would have been totally inaccessible to me otherwise. I spent
my days poring over whatever design resources I could get my hands on.
Target and the Walker Art Center were both strong forces of great design in the Twin Cities.
It was through their libraries that I discovered a design publication called Emigre. It was incredibly influential in the ‘90s
and was somewhere between a fan zine and lively academic journal that focused on discourse and debate about graphic design.
The Walker Art Center, Target, and Emigre all added to and helped dimensionalize who I was at the time and what I wanted from
 my career in design.

I initially got the idea to attend Yale University from Emigre. A lot of the schools they wrote
about at the time were overseas, but they described Yale as a great choice in the US. I decided to study in their design
program and landed an interview with Michael Rock, who owns the design firm, 2x4, in New York City.
“If I ever find myself not learning, then I figure out how to keep moving forward. That principle has made for a very rich and
engaging career.” </p>

  <p> “As a young designer, the professional work I did was wonderful and interesting, but it often became repetitive.
     Teaching gave me time outside of my daily practice to reflect and try to articulate why being a designer was important
     and why my students should care about the problems they tried to solve.” </p>

<h2> <center> Did you immediately decide to study design in college? </center> </h2>

<p> Not initially. Once I got to Yale, I cherry-picked a few design classes but stayed dedicated to a literature
and writing track. Then I realized that in order to do great design, I needed to fully
commit and study art completely. During my last two years at Yale, I studied drawing with a great painter, Robert Reed, who
recently passed away. He was an amazing man. I also studied with an important mentor, Paul Elliman, as well as Michael Rock.
It was a great time to bring my different interests together and learn how to make design in my own way.
Before graduation from Yale, I thought about studios I could learn from. While attending the 50th anniversary party of
Yale’s graduate graphic design program, I met the designers Bill Drenttel and
Jessica Helfand of Design Observer. We corresponded
after I graduated, and they invited me to work in their studio, Winterhouse.</p>

<h3> Do you have anything you’d say to your younger self when you were starting out? </h3>

<p> I have two bits of advice for my younger self. First, I didn’t understand until later in my career how important it
is as a designer to listen. That is the first thing I’d tell myself. At Project Projects, I had phone calls with new clients,
and at one point I realized that my desire to please them and show them how much I knew wasn’t as important as allowing them
to talk and become intrigued by the mystery of what it would be like for us to work together. Even if I had already started
to formulate ideas, I needed to let the person bringing the project to me finish all of their thoughts before I spoke.
Listening is so important, and I feel like a lot of new designers don’t understand that. It takes time.
The second bit of advice I’d offer to my younger self is to be patient with recognition. It’s important to ask for recognition
when you need it and to have good support systems around you, but significant recognition takes a long time to earn and is
worth the wait. It’s important to have realistic expectations and not let yourself become prematurely frustrated. </p>

<h4> Looking at your long-term contribution to the world of design, have you thought about legacy? </h4>
<p>  I’m tremendously proud of the work I did for the 2012 Olympics bid and the work I did with Project Projects for the SALT
Museum in Istanbul. I’m also proud of the work we’ve done at Google around launching the new identity and the conference,
SPAN2015, that we held last October. I hope these things are remembered.
I would also like to leave a legacy with my writing. Over time, I hope that it endures and remains valuable and important for
people. Looking back at the last decade, I hope that creative leadership, mentorship, and teaching are also a part of my legacy.
 The best gift is to teach many designers who will do smarter and more thoughtful work in the future. After almost 15 years of
teaching design, I feel like I’m doing pretty good!interview close </p>

making enough money or being creatively challenged…but you’ll learn much more about what you want by going after your first
choice.”” </p>
