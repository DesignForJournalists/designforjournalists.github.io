<div class="main-text"><p><strong>Describe your path to becoming an illustrator.</strong></p>
<p>I started in a very liquid way. Since I was a kid, it was pretty normal for me to think about becoming whatever I wanted because I was lucky to have two artists as parents—my dad is a photographer and my mom is a painter. Nobody told me, but I knew from the beginning that I could be whatever I wanted and I never thought about making money or building a career—I just focused on what I liked, which was nice. I didn’t realize the decisions that others had to make until I was an adult and saw my friends being forced to find their own path, with their parents being very present in the process.</p>

<p>I started drawing at a young age; it was a good meditation for me. There were so many personalities and egos in the family because we’re all artists, so I needed to find my own space to make. In the beginning, it was the floor in my room where I would lay down and draw and invent stories for hours and hours.</p>

<p>Once I was attending middle school, I had to decide what I wanted to focus on for high school. Here, we have four choices of study: scientific, classical, linguistic, or artistic. I wanted to try the artistic track, but my mom thought the classical one would give me better basis for the future, so I ended up studying history, Latin, and Greek. Because of that, I didn’t have the chance to acquire the tools to draw, but I kept drawing on my own.</p>

<p>When I finished high school, I really wanted to keep drawing, so I went to an art school in Milan called Istituto Europeo di Design—the European Institute of Design. It was the only school that had a course in illustration back then and since it was in Milan, it was simple for me to go there while still living with my parents. Going there was good because I had to get organized and draw every day. On the other hand, the exercises were pretty boring and I wasn’t able to express myself how I wanted. When I graduated, I hadn’t developed a style. I knew what I liked, but I wasn’t able to talk in that language and translate what I had in my brain onto paper in the way that I wanted.</p>

<p>About a year after school, I started finding some satisfaction—not in terms of jobs, but in terms of finding a style and putting together a portfolio. As soon as I had a portfolio, I started contacting people. In Italy, Milan is the main city for editorial clients, so I started going to the newsstands and bookstores to see who I liked and then I tried to contact them. In the beginning, nobody responded to me no matter how hard I tried; I was nobody and no one wanted to give me a chance or take a risk on me.</p>

<p>I did do some very small works, but at some point, I decided I needed to try getting work somewhere else. That’s when I went to New York for the first time. I only had a few contacts in the US and somehow, I got the email of Brian Rea, who was the art director for the New York Times’ Op-Ed at the time. I emailed him, but was sure he wouldn’t respond. He gave me an appointment to come show him my portfolio and that’s how it started. Once I had images published in the US, it was a lot easier for me to get work here in Italy.</p>

<p><strong>How long ago was that?</strong></p>
<p>I think it was 2008.</p>

<p><strong>That’s really interesting that your first big job was outside of Italy and was what helped you to get work in Italy.</strong></p>
<p>I think my country is generally very scared of things that are new. The fact that another country like America responded to my work and approved of it was a sign that my work would be well-received in Italy, too. A lot of my colleagues have also had a similar experience.</p>

<p><strong>Have you been freelancing since you graduated from college?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, I have.</p>

<p><strong>You talked about your path and really enjoying drawing from a young age, but did you have an “aha” moment when you realized that illustration was what you wanted to focus on as a career?</strong></p>
<p>I didn’t really know what illustration was; I didn’t know the difference between being a painter and an illustrator. My mom was a painter and had to struggle with getting recognition in the art world and showing her work in galleries. Illustration seemed more connected to something that would give me the ability to actually pay my rent without having to care about being inside a specific scene. I didn’t consider myself an outsider when I was in high school, but I was into punk rock and books and was really in my own world: I didn’t view myself as an artist who could reach certain levels of popularity, so illustration seemed more appropriate for me. That way, I could keep my work private in journals and sketchbooks and enjoy it more.</p></div>

    <span class="block-quote-element"><strong>What kind of legacy do you hope to leave?</strong> I think I would love to be remembered as a person who did something good. It doesn’t matter if that means becoming a great artist, being the mother of the best scientist on the planet, or inventing a new kind of pasta.</span>
