<h1>Meredith Jenks</h1>
<p> Interview by Tina Essmaker</p>
<p> January 12, 2016</p>
<p>
Meredith Jenks is a New York-based commercial photographer whose photos range from quiet fashion portraits to energy-filled action shots. Her clients include Converse, Nike, The New Yorker, and Bloomberg Business Week, among others. When she is not shooting for work, she is probably taking iPhone photos of her dog, Mouse.</p>

<h2>Where did you grow up?</h2>
<p> We moved around. We lived in England for a year before we moved to Sedona, Arizona, for seven years, and then ended up in Northern California. I went to middle school in Mendocino and then went to Cate School, a boarding school near Santa Barbara, which was an interesting little twist.

While at boarding school, I took a photo class on a whim. For most people, it was a slacker class, but I was into it. When the class started, I thought, “Well, maybe I won’t actually become a fashion designer. Maybe I’ll become involved by shooting it.” I still really loved fashion, and thought it was magical to be able to create those scenarios on the pages.</p>
<p>In my sophomore year of high school, my photo teacher sent a photo I took to an international contest. I don’t know how big the contest actually was, but I won. I got a brick of 35mm black and white film and a gift certificate to B&H. This was the first time that I had ever won anything, and it felt good. I became known around school as the photographer girl. It became part of my persona.

I decided that I wanted to be a photographer when I was 16. It was an easy decision because my dad was an artist. I knew there were artists out there who created for a living, so I didn’t feel pressure to do something else.</p>

<h2>Tell me about your path to becoming a photographer.</h2>
<p>My dad is an oil landscape painter, so I was exposed to art while growing up. My dad took us to museums often and I did my first oil painting when I was seven years old.

<aside class="pull-quote">“It’s important to get your name and work out there, even if you feel insecure about your work and don’t think it’s ready to show. Just show your work and take jobs. It’s practice.”</aside>
<p>Growing up, I wanted to be a fashion designer. My grandparents both thought that was cute, so when I was 10, they got me a subscription to Vogue. So, from a young age, I was exposed to fashion and fashion photographers. I noticed Helmut Newton’s photos early on. Those were the ones that really stuck out to me in the magazine. That’s when I realized that there were people who made that imagery.</p>
</p>


<h2>What kind of work are you doing right now?</h2>
<p> I do everything. I’ve been shooting food for The New Yorker. I’ve shot accessories and done reportage. Celebrities are fun, but there’s also ego involved, so you can’t always do what you want. I love shooting fashion because it’s a little more creative. You have more control over the situation, which I like. I do think that shooting a beautiful portrait of someone I think is cool for W or Vanity Fair would be amazing.</p>

<h2>What advice can you offer to a photographer who is starting out?</h2>
<p> Shoot as much as you can. Even when I wasn’t working, I shot with a little Canon PowerShot G10 camera everywhere I went. That’s important because people notice if you’re adding new work to your website.

E-mail people. I’ve cold-called and emailed so many people since I’ve started. It’s important to get your name and work out there, even if you feel insecure about your work and don’t think it’s ready to show. Just show your work and take jobs. It’s practice.

</p>
<p>Promos matter. Last year I started doing bigger, more expensive promos, partially because I needed a write-off and partially because I wanted to send something that felt like a zine. I had emailed the Converse art buyer for a few years. She was always nice and said my work was cool, but I never got any work. Last year, I sent her a big promo poster and she hired me because of it. Since then, I’ve shot for them three times. The New Yorker magazine hired me because of a promo I sent last year. Even if you get one job, it’s worth it because you’ve opened up the door to a relationship with someone who didn’t know about you before. The industry is small and people move around a lot. If you do a good job, they remember you and will bring you with them.

To sum it up, there are three things in photography: 1) Who you know: building those relationships, 2) Business: understanding the money side, and 3) Talent. Unfortunately, all three are pretty equal; it’s not just about taking a good picture.</p>

“I have wanted to do this since I was 16, and now I’m doing it in New York, shooting for clients I always wanted to shoot for and making a living. That’s incredible to me, so yeah, I feel fulfilled.”

  “I don’t consider myself a fine art photographer; I know I’m a commercial photographer. I might make images that people want to put on their walls, but I’m not reading into my process. I just want to take interesting pictures.”
</div>
<h2>Has your definition of success evolved over the course of your decade-long career?</h2>
<p>All I ever wanted was to live off of photography. Now that I’m doing that, I’m happy. Obviously, when you live in New York, your perspective changes. In LA, it’s easy to squeak by. Here, you can walk down the street and see into the window of someone’s million dollar townhouse and think, “I wouldn’t mind that.” I try not to focus too much on that type of financial, superficial stuff. For me, it’s more about people being receptive to my work. It’s exciting when a young person emails me to tell me they like my work. Even this—it’s cool that you know my work and want to talk to me about how I got to where I am.</p>

<p>There’s also something to be said about keeping low overhead. There are photographers who have big studios and staff, and I’m not sure I ever want to get into that. I currently have a cheap studio and office space in Crown Heights, which I split with a few friends. I like to keep overhead low because I don’t want to have to say yes to a job I don’t want to take in order to keep up. I’d rather have the freedom to grow over time. The beauty of freelance is that if I have a week where I shoot six days in a row, I can take the next day off and watch TV all day. (laughing) I can take a break if I want to.</p>

<h2>Are there any photographers you’re following right now?</h2>
<p>  I don’t know who shot it, but I was in Zara during the holiday season and saw their upcoming Spring 2016 campaign. It’s gorgeous. I think they built a set outside and shot at sunset, but it looked like it was in a house with plants growing all over the place. It was beautiful. I love that it’s Zara, which is a pretty widely known brand. They’re everywhere and people are seeing those images, which are basically fine art.

I also like Charlie Engman. He’s doing some really cool things. His stuff is pretty flash on camera light, but he started out messing around with paper, punching a hole in it and having a limb come through or rolling up a couple seamless backdrops. I’m assuming he did it on his own, but it’s something that’s difficult to do. I worked on an ad job where they were obviously inspired by his setup and the prop stylist wasn’t quite able to capture it with the same precision. Respect to Charlie Engman cause he killed it. Anyone who starts a trend is interesting to me. The people who stand out are the ones who are doing something different.</p>

<p>I definitely look at a lot of photography, but I like to find inspiration in other places, too. I find that in ad work, people often want to copy things. That bothers me. I’ve been tricked into it a couple of times and it makes me feel bad. As a professional, you want to be the one making an image that others want to copy. Now that I’ve been around the block, I’ve gotten better at saying, “I don’t want to do that.” It can be an awkward moment on set, but you hired me to be me—not someone else.</p>

  “It would be the ultimate to go back to high school and tell the students that they, too, can do this. Photo class isn’t just a slacker class. It’s something you can do for a living.”.

  <h2>
You said that your initial goal was to sustain yourself with photography. Now that you’re doing that, have you thought further ahead, like about what kind of legacy you want to leave when it’s all said and done?</h2>
<p> I would be honored if anyone remembered me at all. When someone wants to interview me or when someone emails me, I guess that’s part of my legacy—that I’m even at a point where people know who I am or follow my work. That’s exciting to me.</p>

<p>In terms of physical work or books, that’s not on my radar. I would do it, but it’s a lot of work. I’m a hustler and I can work hard, but there are certain things I’m lazy about because I don’t care. On the other hand, my high school hit me up to do a show, and I’m going to do it. It will be a lot of work, but it’s going to be fun. My photos will be up at my old high school and a bunch of students will look at them. It would be the ultimate to go back to high school and tell the students that they, too, can do this. Photo class isn’t just a slacker class. It’s something you can do for a living.</p>
