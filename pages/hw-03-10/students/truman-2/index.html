<h3>Interview by Tina Essmaker February 9, 2016</h3>

<div class="border">
  <span>–––At the age of 30, Jedidiah Jenkins quit his day job and embarked on a 16-month, 10,000-mile bike trip from Oregon to Patagonia, Chile, the self-imposed catalyst for pursuing his dream of writing a book. After garnering a massive online following for writing about his travels, he has since returned home to LA, where he recently launched a magazine, Wilderness, and is currently working on a book about his cross-continental adventure–––</span>

         <strong>Tell me about your path to what you’re doing now.</strong> I grew up in Nashville, Tennessee, to parents who were both creative. Back in the ‘70s, they traveled across America for five years and wrote about their experiences for National Geographic. Their journey captured the imagination of America because the country was having an identity crisis at the time—the Vietnam War was going on, the president had left office, and everything was a shitshow. I don’t want to call them eccentric, but it didn’t surprise me when they got divorced in the ‘80s. Being raised by two free spirits meant that the conventional track most humans find themselves on—the assembly line of life—didn’t tempt me like it does others. My parents told me, “Go, do, be, and dream. There’s nothing out of reach, and you can have an unconventional life as long as you’re true to yourself.”

         <strong>What advice do you have for someone starting out?</strong> I’ve been thinking about the why behind the why. In my case, I thought I wanted to be a film director because I like telling stories—that was my first why. But when I moved to California and studied directing, I realized that I hated it. I learned that directors are basically the boss of 200 people, and I am not good at that. I felt lost. I knew I wanted to tell stories, and when I asked myself why, I realized it was because I liked to connect with people. I recognized that I enjoyed the storytelling part of being a director, but not the boss part, and that’s when I decided to switch to creative writing. All of a sudden, I had found the fulfillment in writing that I thought I would find in directing. My advice to people starting out is to follow your curiosities, hold your goals loosely, and try to figure out what you really want.

<div class="quote">“I believe in the goodness of humanity, and I find human beings so beautiful. I think it’s our self-hatred that creates feverish little monsters that go around hurting people. If we understood that we are all lovely and lovable, we would hurt fewer people.”</div>

         <strong>Have you had any mentors along the way?</strong> <class="quote3"> Definitely, although mentorship is such a lost idea in modern culture. Growing up, most people don’t typically spend a significant amount of time with older people apart from family members. For instance, if you’re in high school, everyone you know is in high school; when you go to college, almost everyone you hang out with is college-aged. So many people go through crises because they don’t know what to do during different seasons and stages of life, but it would be so much more manageable if you had someone 10 or 15 years older than you to say, “It’s going to be okay. Here’s how you do it.” I didn’t have those people to talk to until I was in college and started to make friends who were older than me. Through those friendships, I found confidence to no longer fear the stages of life that came, but to choose to press into them and become the person I want to be. One of my mentors is Tom Shadyac, who’s in his mid–50s. When he speaks, I think, “Wow, you have thought all of my thoughts, only better, and you’ve tried them out.” The relationship I have with him has really helped shape my mind. I’m so grateful for it, because now I’m excited to be in my 50s and pour wisdom into people the way he has poured his wisdom into me and so many others.
