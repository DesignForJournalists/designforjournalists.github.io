<div class="title"> <span class="future"> The Future is </span> <span class="Bright"> Bright</span> <p><span class="subtitle"> An exploration into editorial design as it <i>will be</i> </span></p>

<div class="body1"> <hr>As we, the millennial generation, collectively dive further into the interconnected world that is 2016, the bounds of design, journalism and media as a whole, will undoubtable be tested, stretched, melded, broken and stitched back together again. What once stood as separate entities have become so inter-complimentary it is hard to imagine them as independent narratives. We as visual, auditory and sensory consumers have demanded integrative sources of information, and with each click, tap and “Hey siri,” we are able to individualize our experience. And this is only the reality of the present. So what does it indicate about the future?

<p><strong>I hypothesize a colorful one.</strong></p></div>

<div class="pullquote"> "We want to provide a variety of access points for people to get to our recipes to cook from, but we still think that there's such a wonderful experience from sitting down with a printed issue that you can't replicate quite the same way in the digital realm." <p><span class=Kevin> Michele Outland </span></p></div>

<div class="body2"<p>In 2013, Forbes published an article entitled “Why Infographics Rule,” stating that around 65 percent of the population are visual learners. The article sites the popularity of viral memes and videos as examples of the universal nature of infographics. As the internet becomes increasingly image-saturated, a distinction between convenience and quality imagery will widen. Gather Journal has capitalized on this by publishing their semi-annual magazine that reads as a ever-so-subtly themed cookbook, but entirely reinvented. Rest assured, there are no checkered tablecloth frames in sight. What you’ll find instead is perfectly curated photography, minimalist design and effortless sophistication. The glossy pages feel more like an editorial fashion spread than any recipe book you have ever seen.</p> <p>Michele Outland, Creative Director and Cofounder of the journal intends to keep the print experience alive, and does so in a very intentional way. Gather frequently updates a website and app with content that complements, instead of detracting from from their original print magazine. By specializing different aspects, publications like Gather are able to remain current and relevant without compromising the value of their central investment.</p></div>

<div class="body2">I spoke with Kevin Kosterman, founder of <a href="http://ebeandesign.com/">ebean design</a>, his own freelance graphic design firm, about this movement toward visual storytelling. He told me that in order to be a successful storyteller in today’s world, one must recognize design as a ubiquitous part of journalism. This involves creating a sort of “choose your own adventure” for readers. “You can’t just tell people what to think anymore, you give them all the bells and whistles and let them pursue the story the way they want to.” Whether that be through photography, video, graphics, or audio, the idea is to put a variety of elements on the table to allow each reader, or perhaps more adequately, “experiencer,” to interpret their own specialized understanding.

<div class="pullquote2"> "The days of having presence in just one media form are done.
The <strong> and </strong> is a necessity." <p><span class=Kevin>Kevin Kosterman </span></p></div>
<br>
<div class="body2"> <p>Richard Turley, Creative director of Bloomberg BusinessWeek, brings words to life with his vibrant, often comical, interplay of words, directed photography, and graphic design. In our fast-paced and ever-quickening society, Turley’s designs are more than humorous. As a leading business journal, many of the featured articles focus on markets and statistics, easy things to skim over in a magazine. Bloomberg’s bold, colorful graphs force readers to take a second look, and to take in the information. Small pieces of text are often interspersed between a dramatic chart, taking the eye on a twisting adventure accross the page. The text and graphics are inseperable, together creatig a larger picture more powerful than either of the two alone.</p></div>

<div class="body2"><p>This idea of specializing the user experience in a way that is adaptive and speaks to individuals in different ways, is not a concept nearing extinction. It has shaped many facets of life in this decade; everyone from producers, journalists and marketers are looking for new ways to customize their output. I predict that what we have seen so far, is just the beginning. </p>

  <p><a href="www.getfoxtales.com">Foxtales</a>, which brands itself as a “custom interactive experience for events,” have taken marketing into the third dimension. Their level of customization literally has no bounds, from personalized beverages and gif photo booths to temporary tattoo stations and finger runways. They have come up with hundreds of ways to tell a brand’s story Noting their abundant success, it's not difficult to imagine editorial design exploring its own bounds within interactive storytelling mediums. <p>
<p>These examples serve as a reference of what is to come. Gathered and Bloomberg BusinessWeek both integrate various mediums, but the two do so in different ways. This shift toward interactive and integrative media is one that both publications recognize, but demonstrate in unique ways. We can see then, that the future of editorial design will complicate itself further yet, media of all kinds blending and reinforcing one another. Each publication will seek to retain its vantage point, while also appealing to individuals on a personal basis. New interactive devices will emerge, complicating matters further yet. In essence, the future of editorial design is resembles that of a tie dye shirt, <strong>vibrant and messy.</strong></p></div>
