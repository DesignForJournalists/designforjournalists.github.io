    <p><strong>Interview based web blog/magazine</strong> Pottentially made as an Ipad application. Would look at Russh, ID and others for inspiration. People in their twenty's, looking at carree, lifestyle, fashion etc... Posting three days a week. Would feel like a blog but visually more editorial.<p>
    <p><strong>Fashion Magazine?</strong> Looking at Vanity Fair + Vogue (Paris/LDN)+ID. Most likely be a printed magazine. Published once monthly<p>
