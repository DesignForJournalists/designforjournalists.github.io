     <p><span>J</span>ournalism used to be a very straightforward way of getting information to the masses, but fast forward to the present day and you have your iPhone telling you what is happening in the world before you’ve even gotten out of bed. As competition has been fiercely increasing to become the first to report on something, the ways in which information is designed to be read and digested becomes more and more crucial to its success and, as an old graphic design professor of mine told me during my short career as a journalist, “Design is everything.”

</p> <br /><p> Take Rookie Magazine for example. A teenager from Chicago felt the need to create a space where conversations around issues she was dealing with were allowed and encouraged, thus came <i>The Style Rookie.</i> As the publication grew in popularity, and as its creator, Tavi Gevinson, also grew up, the online publication became much more appropriately designed for its viewers. The content was published 3 times daily: around 4:00 pm after school, at dinner time, and before bed. Some other elements of design that really personalized the whole feel of the online magazine were the monthly themes (for example courage, imitation, or angst), as well as the frequently changing background image on the actual website itself (meant to imitate the indecisiveness of a teenager changing her blog). Both of these aspects were done tastefully and well, especially since Gevinson was able to get web design expertise from Rumors Studio’s Renda Morton.</p> <br />

<p><span>J</span>ournalism is headed in a direction that is geared heavily towards design, interaction, and immersion into content. As a reader, you can find the same news and facts on almost every major news publication, but what draws a reader back to the same site is often the design of the content.</p>

<br /><p>Another neat example of the future of how news will be relayed to its audience is through <i>The New York Times’</i> Virtual Reality goggles that they released in late 2015. Talk of VR’s success and drawbacks have been a topic of debate during the last year but the mass release of this product got everyone talking.</p> <br />

<p><span>R</span>eaders and subscribers are now, through an exclusive NYT app, able to have a 360º view of an actual event, imitating the feeling of being present. Allowing its readers to fully immerse themselves in news and events like that absolutely changes the business of journalism. Now, I am not a credible source to say whether this change is good or bad, but I attended a talk about VR at SXSW in Austin, TX where experts in the field said that there are technologies being programmed right now that will one day be able to track our eye movements to see what kinds of items we’re interested in while using VR headsets. This kind of technology is groundbreaking and changes the way that consumers are experiencing taking in information.</p>


<br /><p>As journalism becomes more and more fluid, with most people being able to post their thoughts and feelings on their own website, and with an increasing amount of people seeing breaking news on their Facebook feed before they even read about it, it has become clear that the design of how we are digesting and interacting with content is more important now than it has ever been before. I think that most of the public has adapted to the changes in design for journalism, but now it’s time for journalists to start creating content with design thinking in mind.</p> <br />
