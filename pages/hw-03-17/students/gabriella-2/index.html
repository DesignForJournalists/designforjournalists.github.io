    <h1><i>Final Project</i></h1>
    <p>For my final project I would like to throw together a website that caters to women in their early twenties (similar to Rookie or NYLON Magazine, but for women 19-29).It would surround a monthly theme and would feature personal essays, photo series, poetry, fictional writing, news, fashion/red carpet coverage, beauty tips, and much more.</p>
    <br></br>
    <p> the audience would be women in the above age range, and ideally it would be updated daily. It would be nice to eventually publish an annual magazine as well, which would feature the best pieces from the past year as well as exclusive content.</p>
