<h1>FUTURE OF PRINT</h1>

<h2>“Newspapers shouldnt try to compete directly with the Web, and should do what they can do better, which may be long-form journalism and using photos and art, and making connections with large-form graphics and really enhancing the tactile experience of paper.” -Dave Eggers</h2>

<p><span class="drop-cap">W</span>ith the introduction of the internet, journalism faced many challenges. As we learn to adapt, many argue that print will be extinct and that everything will move to a digital format. While digital is certainly going to be the main way people consume their news, its existence has opened an opportunity for print publications to provide a thoughtful, well designed product.</p> 

<p>Consumers can now see a print publication almost as a novelty item, or as something decorative and meaningful. Long-form digital content doesn't capture readers’ attention in the same way that long-form print content does. A physical copy of something demands your attention, where a digital article shows you ten different things to click through to as you read.</p>

<p>WAX Magazine, a New York-based biannual print magazine “that has the feeling of a zine but the high aesthetic values of a fine art journal” is a great example of where print journalism is headed.</p>
    
<p>Cofounder David Yun said of their decision to focus on print, “There is something particularly rewarding about making an object versus making something that lives in the digital form. Creating something printed and bound also seemed to fit the kind of stories we wanted to tell and the way we wanted to tell them. It’s very hard to get people to invest in a 3,000-word article on their computers. A printed piece slows the reader down, which can be a nice experience.”</p>

<p>The ability to reflect and take time to produce a story allows publications to product more affective content. And while WAX focuses mainly on their print product, some of their stories also exist on their expertly designed website as a way to promote and sell their print magazine.</p>
    
<p>Vanity Fair Italia, a 300-page Milan-based weekly print magazine “with a preference for high-quality photography” and “content that feels true to its readers’ interest,” is another great example of the future of print journalism. Their social media pages boast the phrase “Quality is our Business Plan,” letting consumers know right from the start what their product is about.</p>

<p>Creative Director Devin Pedzwater came on board in 2012, with the mission to simplify their design. He argues that an effective editorial experience is made by “really [breaking] it down to just the basics, and [cutting] everything else out.” He says thats when you are “delivering content in a branded way.” The print format makes sense for a magazine like Vanity Fair Italia because they have beautiful original photography and long-form stories. Like WAX, Vanity Fair Italia is able to offer a product that people really take their time with, and that they might even come back to. </p>

<p>The idea that content gets offered over different platforms lets creators imagine it in different ways. A short form breaking news item can be offered on a mobile or online platform to quickly alert the public of something happening. That same news story can be hashed out and reflected on, thoughtfully researched, paired with beautiful original photos, and laid out in a compelling way in a print story later. Digital isn’t killing print, it’s offering print an opportunity to be great again. </p>
