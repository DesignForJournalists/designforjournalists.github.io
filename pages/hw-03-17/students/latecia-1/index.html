<p> <center> Pitchfork is a online music publication that is created by Ryan Schreiber and owned by Condé Nast.
Mainly Chicago based, Pitchfork is devoted to music, journalism, news, album reviews, and feature stories.
Founded in 1995 by Ryan Schreiber, who was working in a record store at the same time, the magazine originally had a
reputation for its extensive interest in independent music, but it has since expanded with a variety of coverage on both
indie and popular music artists. The site generally reports on new music. however Pitchfork has  also reviewed reissued
albums and box sets. The site has published "best-of" lists  such as the best albums of the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, and
the best songs of the 1960s – as well as annual features detailing the best albums and tracks of each year since 1999.
(On October 24, 2003) An editor of pitchformula.com reported that Pitchfork had published 5,575 reviews from 158 different
authors, with an average length of just over 520 words. Together, the reviews featured a total of
 2,901,650 words.</center> </p>

<p> <center> Billboard is a media brand that is owned by The Hollywood Reporter and Billboard Media Group. Billboard magazine is a weekly print publication as well as a daily online publication that  publishes news, video, opinion, reviews, events and style. Billboard is famous for their music charts (Billboard Hot 100 and Billboard 200), they track the most popular songs and albums that are categorized by different genres. Most of the print publication’s stories are written by editorial staff writers, while others are written by industry experts. Billboard’c charts track music sells, radio airtime and other various data about the most acclaimed songs and albums in the world. Wikipedia states that “Billboard has a print circulation of 17,000 and an online readership of 1.2 million unique monthly views. The website includes the Billboard Charts, news separated by music genre, videos, and a separate website. It also compiles lists, hosts a fashion website called Pret-a-Reporter, and publishes eight different newsletters. The print magazine's regular sections include”.
Billboard is considered one of the most reputable sources of music industry news and Pitchfork's views have gained an increase
of cultural currency in recent years; some individuals in the mainstream media view the site as a platform for the independent
music scene, and positive quotes from its reviews are  used in press releases and affixed to the front of CDs. The reason why
I chose to talk about Pitchfork and Billboard Magazine is because both of these publication write, document, and analyze music.
The difference with Pitchfork is that their company focuses on obscure indie rock, and less on other genres. The majority of
criticism, is aimed at Pitchfork’s album reviewing style. Critics argue the site often emphasizes a reviewers' own writing
over the actual music being reviewed, sometimes not even reviewing the album and instead disrespecting the integrity of the
artist. According to Wikipedia, “Pitchfork is also known to give "0.0" ratings, deeming the work as utterly worthless. One
critic wrote that Pitchfork's "0.0" rating of a particular album amounts to no more than a "cheap publicity stunt" for a website
that "thrives on controversy."Looking through the lens of Billboard, one can say that the state of journalism is thriving in
music. The thing about Billboard that pulls readers in are the numerous variety types of music and genres that they display in
their articles and on their charts. Another thing about Billboard is they are unbiased in their written pieces, and they do not
disrespect the artist’s integrity. With Pitchfork, they seem to rate the artist on a harsh scale that attacks their craft.
Billboard is less on giving their opinions and puts more emphasis on informing the reader. Pitchfork displays to pull on gaining
more media coverage and thriving on creating infamous moments. Pitchfork is more of a smaller publication than Billboard,
whereas Billboard does work on a global scale. </center> </p>

<p> <center> Initally speaking with Catya who is currently a senior at Parsons The New School of Design, she had strong
words for the state of music magazines as it relates to these two publications. In addition to studying fashion
design Cat has experience for working with Billboard and Pitchfork magazine, with that being said she knows the history of
these two publications and was eager to provide her opinion on the matter. </center> </p>

<aside class="pull-quote"> <p> "It seems that Pitchfork’s method of using their journalistic integrity it completely opposite from Billboards,
Billboard cites facts and Pitchfork is opinionated. Rating an artist’s work as a 0.0 dehumanizes their work and artistic
vision. The principal rule of journalism is to report with a tone that is informative and not negatively affecting others.
This can sometimes make for great journalism, but other times could lead to a method of madness"
