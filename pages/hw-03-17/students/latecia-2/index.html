  <body> -The idea for my next project is a travel publication. The content that this idea would contain (in the print section;
  Annual Edition)  is an in depth analysis of one country. The content would depict that region's customs, favorite tourist
  locations, great food or bar spots, and the unique fashion / style that the location is known for.
  -The online (weekly) content would have generalized stories of every cities and the favorite hotspots, local events,
  and celebrities/socialites talking about things like their must have items while traveling.
  My audience would be people who are always on the go and constantly traveling,
  weather its a local route (to school or work, or to another country). I want this publication to be indie and underground. </body>

One specific source that inspires me to create this site is Suitecase magazine.

    <body> The idea that I have for this project is a style and beauty magazine. This style and beauty magazine would be online
      and monthly based. I would like to pinpoint fashion (looks for less), hair care, makeup tips into this publication.
    I want thier to be certain sections devoted to assisting people in their everyday lives. I want to have a section where
    their are monthly profile pieces on different beauty bloggers
    ( Q and A's as well as backstorys on the different backgrounds that they came from)

    Two blogs that I would want to draw from are blog sites from beauty bloggers "Ducle Candy and Nitra B"
