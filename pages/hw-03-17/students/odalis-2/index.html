    <h1>Final Proposals</h1>

    <h2>Entertainment Publication</h2>
    <img src="file:///Users/odalisgarcia/Desktop/SKMBT_75416033011120_0001.jpg">
    <p><strong>What would the subject matter be?</strong></p>
    <p>For this publication I would like to have it be all about the TV/Film/Theater entertainment industry. For this one I have drawn inspiration from Entertainment Weekly, Vulture, and Bustle. I really admire the way in which both Vulture and Bustle analyze and critique TV shows and film, and show a deeper aspect to what we watch than just plain fodder. And that's something that I've always been interested in-mostly because I watch too much TV-and I think it would be interesting to create something like that.</p>
    <p><strong>Who would be the audience?</strong></p>
    <p>I think the audience for this would be just a general TV/Movie watching audience-with an added theater loving audience. But more specifically I would like for the publication to highlight the lack of diversity within Hollywood, Broadway, and the entertainment industry in general. I want to have a strong presence among women and people of color-and others who don't see themselves as represented in mainstream media.</p>
    <p><strong>How often would you publish it?</strong></p> 
    It would be continous publication since I would plan for it to have a mostly online presence.
    <p><strong>Would it be a small independent mag, a large news site, or something else?</strong></p>
    <p>It would be a medium-sized (almost blog style) site.</p>
    
    <h2>Latinx Teens and Young Adult Publication</h2>
    <img src="file:///Users/odalisgarcia/Desktop/SKMBT_75416033012360_0001.jpg">
    <p><strong>What would the subject matter be?</strong></p>
    <p>This publication would deal with the ins and outs of being a Latinx teen/young adult. I drew a lot of inspiration from Rookie, which is a very creative and expressive. I want there to be a space that is by these young people who don't necessarily have seen themselves in other forms of media. I also drew inspiration from Remezcla and We Are Mitu. Both sites cover Latino events, culture, music, food, and even news-which I see as something that could also be added contributions to the site.</p>
    <p><strong>Who would be the audience?</strong></p>
    <p>The intended audience would be young Latinx people.</p>
    <p><strong>How often would you publish it?</strong></p> 
    <p>It would have a continous presence online but I also think (a little Rookie style) that once a month an issues could be published in print with contributions and submissions. Whether it's poetry or photography and even news articles.</p>
    <p><strong>Would it be a small independent mag, a large news site, or something else?</strong></p>
    <p>I see it as both an independent mag and a website</p>
    
    <h2>News Publication</h2>
    <img src="file:///Users/odalisgarcia/Desktop/SKMBT_75416033012560_0001.jpg">
    <p><strong>What would the subject matter be?</strong></p>
    <p>The subject for this publication would be strictly news. Ranging from news in the U.S. to a style section to tech and politics. I drew on inspiration from Mic, Mashable and a bit from the NYTimes when thinking about this site, because I very much admire the way they design their pages (plus the different and varying sections they have) to make news a lot more approachable and managable for a reader.  </p>
    <p><strong>Who would be the audience?</strong></p> 
    <p>The audience would be anyone within any given age-range that is interested in current events. I would like to make it pretty accessible for both millenials and older generations.</p>
    <p><strong>How often would you publish it?</strong></p>
    <p>It would be on continous publication online.</p>
    <p><strong>Would it be a small independent mag, a large news site, or something else?</strong></p>
    <p>Large news site</p>
