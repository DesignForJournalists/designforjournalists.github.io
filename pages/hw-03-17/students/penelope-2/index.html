<h1>Idea One: Rapture</h1>
<li>What would the subject matter be?</li>
<p>It would be based on the idea of taking a cigarette break. Since rapture means "a feeling of intense pleasure or joy," the website would be a short, simple and sweet EVERYTHING-YOU-NEED-TO-KNOW about the news, entertainment etc. magazine. The intense joy/pleasure part would come from the idea that it's a smoke break when you'd be reading these articles.

<li>Who would be the audience?</li>
<p>The audience, I guess, naturally, would be smokers since the idea is during a smoke break, but really anyone who works who takes breaks and is interested in keeping up to day with the latest.</p>

<li>How often would you publish it?</p>
  <p>It would be published everyday, generated by things like Twitter, facebook NYT and stuff and bring you the latest news you need to know what's being talked about</p>

<li>Would it be a small independent mag, a large news site, or something else?</li>
<p>It would be a news site, not necessarily large but more of a generator to collect all the information through analytics that is trending or important etc. It could also have a small mag publication with feature pieces on what was talked about online, sort of like IRE.
</p>


<h1>Idea Two: ArtweAll</h1>

<li>What would the subject matter be?</li>
<p>It would be all about Art within the city, sort of like Art forum but with a younger generations perspective and with younger less-wellknown upcoming artists interviewed and listed. </p>

<li>Who would be the audience?</li>
<p>The audience would be young art lovers and anyone who wants to see what the lives of the upcoming art world looks like. </p>

<li>How often would you publish it?</li>
<p>It would be a monthly publication. </p>

<li>Would it be a small independent mag, a large news site, or something else?</li>
<p>It would be a small independent magazine, but would hopefully have a large following (something similar to WAX).</p>


<h1>Idea Three: FEMALE</h1>

<li>What would the subject matter be?</li>
<p>It would be all about female empowerment and the latest news/interviews that have to do with females in the world. It would have categories like Art, Entertainment, etc. and each category would have information or interviews or videos/photos of females in that category. It is a magazine that is trying to empower women by giving the latest news about women doing great things in the world. </p>

<li>Who would be the audience?</li>
<p>The audience would hopefully be everyone really. But mainly women of the younger generation and also older generations. </p>

<li>How often would you publish it?</li>
<p>it would be published online weekly, but have a bi-monthly small print magazine that covers the top women that month or top stories. </p>

<li>Would it be a small independent mag, a large news site, or something else?</li>
<p>It would be both small and large. The magazine would be a small zine-esque but the online magazine would be large and newsy- but also creative. </p>
