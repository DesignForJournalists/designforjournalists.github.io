  <h1>The Future of Journalism</h1>
  <div class="intro-paragraph">
    Technological innovations happen everyday, but not as many have had the impact that design has had on journalism and news. Today, media is saturated with all forms of media making it difficult for news publications to maintain brand identity and journalistic integrity. The future of journalism is changing, and becoming a lot more intentional about how it is presented and consumed.

    <span class="first character">O</span> n February 4, 2004 a social networking website was launched at an Ivy League University out of the dorm room of a Boston student. The idea? To connect as many people as possible on an online website in order to create and share experiences.
    <br></br>
    In 1990 a digital ecosystem was created in which information could be shared and saved through a series of urls and hyperlinks, establishing a network of multimedia exchanges.
    <br></br>
    Hundreds of years before this, a machine was invented that would allow for the mass production of thoughts, ideas, stories, and images. Information, that would’ve taken months to years to be written down, would now be shared faster and more accessible to the world at large.
    <br></br>
    Whether it’s Facebook, the World Wide Web, or even the printing press, each innovation has taken information consumption to the next level. But the essential core of these changes is the desire to create a wholesome and new way to experience that information. Journalism is a facet of this evolution. With every technological advancement that has been made, there is one thing that holds true to creating that experience and that is design. From pamphlet to newspaper to phone applications, there has been someone somewhere who created it— who designed it. And with these advancements, the way in which these platforms design change as much as what is being created and invented.
  </div>

  <div class="Paragraph5-9">
    <br></br>
    Each of these innovations, regardless of how far or close they are in time, have one thing in common: conceptual experience. The future of journalism— the future of any information consumption platform— is in the way a publication, company, or organization compiles that information into a branded identity that is more than aesthetically pleasing, but rather into something that is exploratory, developmental, and maybe even adventurous to consume.

    The printing press allowed for news to touched rather than heard. The newspaper was laid out in columns, intersecting margins and text, sprinkled with images all to be rolled up and wrapped with a rubber band or neatly folded and tucked into a back pocket.

    The World Wide Web allowed for news to be accessible at a faster rate to a broader audience. News was designed to shrink into fitted screens and to be interwoven with medias of all forms.

    Social networking, such as Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat, were harnessed to make news a shared experience. These platforms design news to be fast, compact, and visually beautiful.

    News is about storytelling, and the relationship between journalism and design is much like that of the plot and the novel, it’s what gives the subject substance. It’s what makes a human pick up a book, but more importantly it’s what keeps them reading.
  </div>

  <div class="Paragraph10-12">
    <br></br>
      <img src="http://d.gr-assets.com/books/1381325053l/18249484.jpg" alt="designing_edit_exp" style="display:inline; float:left; width:150px; height:187px; margin-right:5%;">

    News publications, young and old, have been working on crafting this experience for their readers while simultaneously staying true to the integrity and brand of who they are. The struggle that emerges with digital advancements in journalism is the need to maintain the publications identity on multiple platforms all at once. Today, people consume news via their phones, laptops, tablets, and print newspaper. The consuming experience on each of those are different based on the boundaries of templates, medias being used in articles (e.g. video, radio, music, interactive, etc.). However, the “demand” for a more meaningful news experience continues to increase. Design becomes an essential tool in telling a story of what has or is happening in the world. As real as the event is, so should the telling of the event, and furthermore, so should the receiving of said news. One must, somehow, translate a sensorial moment in time onto the digital screen, encapsulating what truly happened as much as possible.

    Some publications don’t get this so right. Each platform has too many visual personalities that are inconsistent with the news publications. They redesign without fully understanding what digital can do for their print and vice versa. But sometimes, some news publications get it completely right.

    Take The New York Times for example. With each new challenge that publications face with the rise of technology, NYT has managed to gracefully harness digital’s capabilities while remaining true to their journalistic integrity.

    Take The New York Times for example. With each new challenge that publications face with the rise of technology, NYT has managed to gracefully harness digital’s capabilities while remaining true to their journalistic integrity.
    <br></br>
    In a case study of The New York Times in Designing the Editorial Experience, ___ talks to Tom Bodkin, Chief Creative Officer of the renowned publication about what makes The New York Times a success story when it comes to designing journalism.
    <br></br>
    “I think of myself to some degree as an editor, and I think a good publication designer needs to be as much an editor as a designer. The two things are inseparable. I think you need to speak the language of an editor, and they need to see you as central to the process of telling a story, not just somebody who makes things look pretty. I’ve always felt that that’s what’s interesting about publication design— the content and the substance of it and how design is so internal to that act of communication.”
    <br></br>
    The process that The New York Times has taken is essential in understanding the conceptual experience that is being created to tell news. The future of journalism is about merging. If you merge teams, you can merge skill.
        <div class="block-quote">
        "I think a good publication designer needs to be as much an editor as a designer. The two things are inseparable."
        </div>
    <br></br>
    It’s about creating a team of people who are able to integrate print design skills and digital design skills and using those talents to ultimately tell the story that needs to be told. With the introduction of news being used on the web, designers were not only limited to what they could do but also bound by what they didn’t know.

  </div>

<div class="Paragraph17-19">
  <br></br>
  “So you had digital designers learning to make the best of the limited tools available, becoming very adept at creating templates and starting to understand interactive behavior, but not learning anything about type or concept or story— they weren’t doing storytelling…The magic was in combining classic print design skills with the new digital interface skills. I thought the best way to do it is to get these people to work together,” Bodkin says.
  <br></br>
  The future of journalism also lies within the spans of time and patience. Creating a conceptual experience for readers means taking the transition between print and digital one step at a time— cohesiveness is key. It’s about taking the existing brand and identity of the publication and making small changes over time as opposed to an overnight re-design. The digital experience of news from The New York Times  isn’t as different as their print. The NYT is still the NYT, only with a bit more makeup and a pair of new shoes, not a facelift and breast implants. You still want to be able to recognize the identities, but also appreciate its evolution.
  <br></br>
  “If you go back and look at the paper fifty years ago, it does look very different,” says Bodkin. “But it’s an evolutionary change, where we make adjustments as we come up with new ideas. It’s important when the Sunday paper lands on your doorstep that it all feels as one piece. You want to evoke a certain feeling and emotion, a familiarity— that’s what builds habit. You want people to see a section of The New York Times separated from every other section and still know it’s The New York Times.

<div class="Paragraph20-24">
  <br></br>
  Lastly, the future of journalism lies within continuous innovation. With new platforms and ideas being developed for editorial web experiences, it’s important to not only be open to how to integrate new innovations and ideas into a publication, but also to make sure that it can be personalized for the brand of the publication.
  <br></br>
  As blogging became an integral part of news story telling, confusion and fear arose amongst The New York Times design and content team. It became a question of how the publication could integrate this up and coming facet of journalism while, simultaneously, making sure it fits within the NYT’s identity.
  <br></br>
  “The goal from the start was not to make it feel like a separate identity but actually fold into The New York Times reading experience online,” says NYT Content Strategist and Blog Specialist, Jeremy Zilar. “First, it was figuring out how these things fit into the larger organization visually and from the readers’ experience.” It’s not just a blog, but The New York Times blog— it becomes the super version of a universal idea.

  The New York Times is one simple case. However, there are publications all across the world that are tapping into the arenas. What makes The New York Times a great example of where journalism and design are headed is it’s ability to constantly keep their brand and their reader in mind while uncovering and crafting how they are making digital and print design work for them.
  <br></br>
  The beautiful thing about the future of journalism is its evolution into a fluid and ingenious art form. It’s not about a single solution, but rather a series of creative options. The future of journalism doesn’t have an answer, but rather continuously asks the question “How can we tell this story better?” It’s asking “What is the reader missing and what can we do to provide them with it?”
