  <h>Dope</h>
    <br></br>
<div class="Question">
    WHAT WOULD THE SUBJECT MATTER BE?
</div>
<div class="Answer">
  Dope people do dope things. It would be a small publication that reports on people, businesses, and events that are unique and outside of the box. Whether it’s about food, a book, a human, an event, or even a pet turtle, DOPE’s key goals are to

  1. Pose strong and difficult questions
  2. Uncover and create awareness about new innovations
  3. Create a community of people amongst the people and businesses we report on

  Similar to The Great Discontent, only…

  - target younger crowd
  - more color
  - more fun

<div class="Question">
  HOW OFTEN WOULD YOU PUBLISH?
</div>

<div class="Answer">
  We would seek to publish long articles with heavy image stories every two weeks. At the end of each year, we would compile our strongest interviews and photos to create a print edition to sell to readers.

<div class="Question">
  WOULD IT BE A SMALL INDEPENDENT MAG, LARGE NEWS SITE, OR SOMETHING ELSE?
</div>

<div class="Answer">
  It would be a small independent magazine with a team of
  <br></br>
  2 graphic designers<br></br>
  2 photographers<br></br>
  4 writers (each writer co-edits other writers’ pieces)<br></br>
  1 editor-in chief<br></br>
  1 managing editor<br></br>
  1 video editor<br></br>
  <br></br>
  It’s a small, tight-knit community of young thinkers who aren’t afraid to get it wrong and let it show. They have their eyes constantly pierced for THE NEW, THE DIFFERENT, THE BOLD, and sometimes, THE VERY STRANGE.
