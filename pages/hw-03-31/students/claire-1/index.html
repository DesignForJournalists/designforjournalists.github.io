        <p>Over the last few years, journalism has slowly been making its way onto the web. Since more and more of us are glued to our phones, it’s no wonder that many newspapers are making the transition over to the internet (as well as to mobile and tablet apps). News outlets such as the Huffington Post, BuzzFeed and Vanity Fair Italia are perfect examples. HuffPost, an online newspaper that launched in 2005, capitalised on the idea of news on the web. By using specific algorithms that place posts ranked by popularity, as well as hashtagging each piece, HuffPost created a hub where its readers can find anything from celebrity gossip to hard news stories. It’s no surprise then that Jonah Peretti went on to create BuzzFeed, since both of these outlets seem somewhat similar in how they are pushing their content out to the masses. HuffPost seems to out-source their stories to websites like Facebook, Twitter and Tumblr, meaning their front page is not necessarily where most of their readers first discover articles.</p> 
        
        <p>There is something slightly uninviting about the Huffington Post's front page; it’s hard to know exactly where to start when it comes to navigating it. What’s particularly interesting about the HuffPost is their new(ish) tablet application; the idea of publishing a weekly magazine is kind of genius especially for those who prefer to sit down and read longer articles. This allows HuffPost to seek out two different types of audiences. Their focus on simplicity and usability can easily be seen within the app and doesn’t differ too greatly from the website, allowing the regular, as well as the new, reader to find common ground. The magazine gives writers a space to write longer articles as well as embed media in a new and different way. The way journalism is going today it seems that it is leaning more towards a digital trend. Designers can still make the online versions feel like a magazine or, as HuffPost did, they can make it seem more like a blog. Designer’s choice. The design of Journalism is going where the readers want it to, they are searching for easily accessible content with HuffPost and BuzzFeed providing just that. </p>
        
        <p>Vanity Fair Italia on the other hand is completely different. The magazine pays a tremendous amount of attention to detail and design. The magazine is printed weekly, and after a year without a creative director it was seemingly lost and overloaded. Vanity Fair definitely has a specific look; it is elegant and the editors have the ability to work with some of the best photographers in the whole world. So that is how the new creative director, Devin Pedzwater, chose to redesign the magazine by concentrating on photography, and by having his images fit seamlessly into the background. Pedzwater started from the top and used the inspiration of American Vanity Fair flaunting the comparison, especially since they both fall under the Conde Nast umbrella. It’s particularly interesting to hear him talk about the magazine being reset. </p>
        
        <strong>“Each designer would pair with an editor, and there are five editors that looked after the whole magazine. And so they would operate as individual silos, not really communicating with each other.”</strong> 
        
        <p>In the design world, communication is key, especially for an established magazine such as Vanity Fair. What Devin Pedzwater realised was that his team needed a break, and that they need to work like a well oiled machine. Unlike before, they were now working together to create something that fit seamlessly into the Vanity Fair family. Comparing these very diverse news outlets gives us a good idea of where design is going. Strategy, as well as communication within teams, is extremely important and without these processes a magazine can lose its readership, things can begin to fall apart. When it comes to going mobile, it is important to create a semi-seamless transition from actual paper to device. The magazine’s “hardcopy” design should be similar to what you end up seeing on your mobile device, and you should provide the ability to feature more audio and video content online in a different way. What matters most  is that magazines and news sources need to be listening and looking to their readers for advice, not necessarily following their every word but listening keenly to what they find problematic since they interact with these sources on a weekly or daily basis. The designers are given the liberty to explore how to improve both print and web, but the relationship must remain symbiotic. Magazines and newspapers that started as print don’t plan on becoming fully digital anytime soon. Design in general seems to be going towards making something for every type of reader, and in a way telling them exactly what they need to read and how to go about reading it. </p>
