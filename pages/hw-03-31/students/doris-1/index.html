    <span class="firstLetter">J</span><span>ournalists nowadays heavily rely on social media to inform them of what people want to read. The zeitgeist of contemporary journalism is the transfer of power from writers and editors to the readers. Journalists now recognize that they do not solely hold the power in deciding what events get written on. And readers now have a plethora of options when it comes to news outlets and what kind of news they want to devout their attention to. Journalists find themselves fighting to keep people’s attention. But it is not entirely the fault of the reaers. Because journalism is now so accessible, people are bombarded with news 24/7 a their finger-tips. The issue is, people are flooded with information—journalism is everywhere, but do people really care about the information they are receiving? Is journalism actually engaging readers in the full capacity that it should be?</span>
  </p>
  <p>Journalists find themselves grappling to design methods that keep their readership engaged. Designing journalism has now become a matter of analysis—breaking down how the audience thinks. And in order to determine how to captivate the audience, journalists must go far beyond just disseminating information.</p>
  <p>The future of journalism must mean placing even more emphasis on engagement. In order to predict where journalism is heading, we must destigmatize what journalism has come to be. Journalism cannot merely focus on reporting, and on certain occasions, journalism is going to warrant bias.</p>
  <p>In order to achieve this heightened level of engagement, journalism must become personable. And the way to achieve this is by contextualizing personal, evocative stories within bigger stories and/or current events. Take AJ+ for example, a news outlet which claims to “experience, engage, and empower” its audience. AJ+ is known for its poignant videos often shared on Facebook. In these videos, the news outlet often captures the struggles of individuals whom have fallen victim social, political, or economic crisis i.e. the Syrian refugee crisis. By disseminating personal stories that lay within larger current events, AJ+ is able engage its audience because it not merely reporting—its reporting that attaches faces to these events. And in doing so, these issues provoke a sense of urgency.</p>

  <p>I recently spoke to Cameron Donley, whom in 2009, started a satirical publication about life in Peace Corps (while she herself was serving in the Peace Corps in Thailand). Donley stated, "people have definitely become passive receivers of the news. They are getting so much information in such little time but they aren't engaged—it has merely become overwhelming. They are so detached and overwhelmed, they don't have enough time to process the information yet alone formulate an opinion.”</p>
  <p>An example of a magazine that also contextualizes smaller narratives within larger topics is Anorak. Anorak is an illustrated print magazine comprised of stories, games, and activities for children ages six to twelve. The magazine, which publishes 5 times a year, was founded by Cathy Olmedillas in 2006—who saw the need for a fun children's magazine after she became a mother and observed that "the kids' magazine market was homogenous and hypercommercial."</p>

    </div>
    <p>Though Anorak is a children's magazine it still follows the same model of framing smaller narratives within bigger narratives. For example, Olmedillas devoted an entire issue on the topic of writing. She states, "I wanted to demonstrate how we take it for granted and that in fact, it is an amazing thing to write, and it is magical. I also explore how writing has influenced our history." Now at the surface, it might appear to be impossible to get six year old to grasp those concepts. However, Olmedillas is successful because she employs broad, advanced concepts through smaller, accessible means such games and activities which makes creates more engagement with her audience. It is a similar model, merely for a younger generational cohort.

  <p>Readers nowadays hold much more autonomy than they used to. Though journalists and editors may not be the only ones deciding what topics get written on, it is still their responsibility to design methods that pull readers into stories.</p>
