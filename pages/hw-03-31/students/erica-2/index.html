      Final Project Proposals.

    <div class="body">
        For my first publication I would like to provide a platform for people to express themselves creatively. It would be like a big collaborative zine with readers. It would be published 4 times a year. There would be no specific tartget audience because I would like interaction between all ages. It is inpired by magazines like Illustration Mag and Juxtapoz.

        My second idea is an activity book for adults containing activites revolving around current events. It would be published once a month and the target audience would be adults ages 18+.  It would be similar to the children's magazine Highlights. I thihnk it would be exciting to have a print publication that presents news in as fun and interractive of a way as do online publications.
