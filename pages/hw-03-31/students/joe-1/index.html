<h1>Hey Design For Journalism, Where ya Going?</h1>
<h2> By Joe Reilly

<p>Divs, html, fonts, web layouts, links, click bait, feeds, gifs, if you’re a journalism designer you’re probably writhing around on the floor with joy by now. If you run your own business online or produce a blog and so forth, you’re either feeling stressed over the little things you need to fix on your website or maybe you’re confident in your work; either way the terms mentioned are now as essential in traveling through cyberspace as it is for a surgeon to wear gloves.
In today’s world it’s easy to forget that there is an anatomy to that headline about Kim Kardashian’s latest nude selfie, an anecdote most likely already outdated by the time of this writing, replaced with maybe a new popular meme. But all these things have an intricate structure, coded by web designers after hours of strained eyes and sore backs from hard chairs. But where is Design for Journalism headed? With content having a shelf-life of sometimes only hours, the new shiny layout that will grab the eyes of the office worker on break, kid in class, stay at home parent in between chores, is a variable in a field of feeds, tweets and timelines. The destination for design journalism is much like it’s content—ever changing.</p>

<h1>From a Long Boring Name to Listicles</h1>

<div></div>

<p>In today’s generation of over-sharing and six second videos it’s hard to imagine that design still matters or journalism is still up their along with YouTube challenge videos starring reality show celebrities. But both still flourish and have found a predominant place on the web along with little niches. We look at two case studies today, one which has seemingly mastered turning lists into modern day entertainment—Buzzfeed. And the other taking three horrendously boring words—Bloomberg BusinessWeek, which has found a way to make the business world appealing to everyone from tech nerds to the old-timer reading a newspaper. </p>

<h1>Buzzfeed</h1>

<p>Based out of New York City the website known as Buzzfeed.com delivers content in the form of something most people forget to bring with them to the grocery store—the list. From top ten ways to breakup with your girlfriend to serious long form articles surrounding politics, Buzzfeed caters to a broad audience while keeping things simplistic and feeding off of peoples new age attention spans that only have time for under two-hundred characters. The case study details the term listicle (list article) which is the brainchild of Buzzfeed’s founder Jonah Peretti. The list essentially will use a headline and follows with a number of examples. It works well because the list idea is inexaustible. As soon as a story hits the traditional article driven or televised media, Buzzfeed can use a brevity driven format in taking the story and listing it into brief bullet points; this being far easier and entertaining than the traditonal long form formats. The emphasis here is on design being an equalizer to content. They go hand and hand to keep the reader flowing to the end.  </p>

<aside class="pull-quote">“Buzzfeed is one of the very few publishers with the resources, talent, and focus to build the whole enchilada. And nothing is tastier than a homemade enchilada.” –Jonah Peretti, Buzzfeed Founder. </aside>

<p>So when wondering where design for journalism is headed, in this respect we need to look no further than sites like Buzzfeed.com which singlehandedly redefined how journalism is delivered with an entirely new format. That is if you forget that David Letterman had been doing this for over a decade.</p>

<h1>Bloomberg BusinessWeek</h1>

<p>Now we turn our focus to the Bloomberg BusinessWeek case study. Magazines had always served as a means to kill time in waiting rooms, get information that newspapers weren’t paying attention to, interviews with cultural icons that you couldn’t get anywhere, and also magazines catered to niche markets like home decor and car lovers. In an age where the blogosphere has nearly replaced picking up a magazine while waiting in line at the grocery story, how does one make journalism stay afloat while also mainly making it about business? Uphill battle doesn’t to describe the task at hand but Bloomberg Business week has found a way to do just that and with everything but what you’d expect. Fonts, typography, design, layouts, cover art: these are all things that Bloomberg BusinessWeek has utilized to shift gears to attention grabbing rather than just putting out content and waiting. </P>

<p>Surviving the stock market crash, Bloomberg BusinessWeek has been around since 1929. Up until 2009 it was simply known as Business Week. 2009 would prove to be its second coming when it rebranded itself and accepted the challenge to rise above more culturally appealing magazines.</P>

<aside class="pull-quote">“We’re all very ambitious, and I mean, ambitious to do some-thing different and not repeat ourselves, and to keep pushing and pushing and pushing.”—Richard Turley, Creative Director Bloomberg BusinessWeek</aside>

<p>When wondering where design for journalism is heading in Bloomberg BusinessWeek’s case, it places an emphasis on design as being as equally important to journalism because if you can’t get the readers to come in, the content doesn’t go anywhere. Design meaning who’s on the front? What does the typography do to enhance the person or setting? How are the articles laid out? Where do the pull-quotes fall? And so forth.</p>

<p>In closing, the answer to where is Design for Journalism headed is an answer best answered by what’s working at the moment. Design is obviously a key part in the success of journalism according to these case studies. So, for a simple answer: it’s a necessity if journalistic publishing wants to keep breathing. It’s technique, style and originality will have to keep evolving to compete with new markets, shorter attention spans, six second videos and gaming consoles that are becoming more sophisticated </P>
