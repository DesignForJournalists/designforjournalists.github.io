<em>Image And Name Of Featured Person</em>
<p class="firstp"> This would be a monthly publication that would focus soley on wealthy entrepreneurs. Any one who gained their wealth through tradiotnal means such as college or trade school would be excluded. The subject matter would be oriented around past techniques and strategies used by successful entrepreneurs as a guide for making it without taking the tradional route.</p>
<p> Here would be the month's feature</p>
<div class="inline-element"> Here Would be their story</div>
<div class="inline-element"> Here would be their strategy</div>
<div class="inline-element"> Here Would be their advice</div>
<div class="inline-element"> Here would be their failures</div>

<div class="inline-element"> Links to Past Features</div>
<div class="inline-element"> Universal Tips </div>

<em>Here would be the feature's work</em>
<em>Image And Name Of Featured Person</em>
<p> Here would be the month's feature</p>
<p>Here would be the an interview</P>
  <p class="firstp"> This would be a website targetted towards the obvious--entrepreneurs. In both these sketches I attempted to layout what the website would produce on a monthly basis. This publication would be run independently and would act as a sponsor to its features. As it grows in popularity the site would have ad placement and rely heavily on curration of similar sites.</p>

<div class="inline-element"> Here Would be their advice</div>

<h1 class="First">Motivation Magazine</h1>
<h2 class="Firstt"> We Give You Good Excuses</h2>
<p class="firstp"> This would be an annual publication that would showcase motivational stories, people, claimed miracles, and situations that went in a complete 360. This annual publication would only be availble in print. It would be targetted to every demographic and would have the following sections:</p>
<div class="inline-element"> Finance</div>
<div class="inline-element"> School</div>
<div class="inline-element"> Work</div>
<div class="inline-element"> Home Life</div>
<div class="inline-element"> Spirituality</div>
<div class="inline-element"> Success stories</div>
<div class="inline-element"> Overcoming the odds</div>
<div class="inline-element"> Miracles?</div>
<p>The idea behind this is to target people who are otherwise at the end of their rope or somewhat lost in their lives.It would be in print because I want it to reach everyone from the homeless to people sitting in doctor's offices. It would be published annually due in part to the time it would take gathering real quality content. This publication would be run independently. </P>
<p>Inspiration for this site: Vibe Magazine.</p>

<p>I was inspired by Vibe Magazine for this because of its raw interviews, artistic nature and appeal in range of economic class.

<h1 class="First">Closed Eye Witness</h1>
<h2 class="Firstt"> The News In An Alternate Universe</h2>
<p class="firstp"> This would be a weekly publication that would present the news as if it had good outcomes rather than the grim truths the media serves on a daily basis. So for example, in the publication, terrorist attacks would have never happened. Instead the attacks would have been thwarted by a gang of kittens or something along those lines. The Publication would cater to everyone as a audience, rely heavily on humor and would be availble in online format and print. Some of its sections would be:</p>
<div class="inline-element"> Would News</div>
<div class="inline-element"> What Unicorns Did This Week In Washington</div>
<div class="inline-element"> Work</div>
<div class="inline-element"> Subway Leprechauns</div>
<div class="inline-element"> Medical Breakthroughs</div>
<div class="inline-element"> Prophet's Corner</div>
<div class="inline-element"> Miracles?</div>
<p>Inspiration for this site:Mad Magazine.</p>
<div class="image3">image</div>
<P> I was inspired by Mad Magazine for this publication because as a kid I remember how this magazine made light of very serious topical events and set itself apart almost creating its own world on paper.
