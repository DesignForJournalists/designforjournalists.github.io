        The future of the relationship between journalism and design is going to change. How will this change affect journalism? And will journalists, who were never meant to be designers, be able to keep up wiith it?

        Snapchat. The place where you can suddenly become a puppy and lick the screen of your mobile device. <b><em>But not really.</em></b> If you don’t know what I am referring to, you might want to download the app. While you are on it and after changing your face into a drag queen, a bunny and again a puppy, you could check out their news channels. This vertical news channel is where sources like Vox, CNN, and Buzzfeed try to catch the attention of the 1.55billion users the Financial Times reported Snapchat to have. </p> <div class="image"> <img src="puppyface.jpg" ></div> 
     <p><b>It wasn’t always like this.</b> Just a few months ago, the only use to Snapchat was the sharing of images that are not permanent, but somehow news sources managed to find a way of being a part of the big hit. And it seems like it worked.</p> <p>Journalism is constantly having to adapt. Not just to a platform, but to our new attention span, to our interests, and to what we find new or appealing enough not to swipe down on it. Design in journalism is becoming a balance between both: how pretty it looks and how adaptive it will be on different platforms. Design will challenge journalists to be creative about how they present their content in more than one way.

        In <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2016/02/17/the-future-of-news-and-publishing/">“The Future of News and Publishing”</a> by Justin Pang, Pang talks about how the future of news will be focused on user experience in messaging apps. </p>
     <div class="pullquote">“One important milestone occurred last year when messaging apps surpassed social networks based on number of monthly active users,” says Pang,” as messaging apps grow in scale, they will continue to evolve as service providers with news being a key component of their offerings.” </div>
     <p>Pang suggests that soon Facebook, the owner of the two largest messaging apps, Facebook Chat and Whatsapp, will introduce ways for messaging apps to expand from just peer to peer into a larger conversation between news outlets, businesses, and others.</p> <p> Therefore once again Journalists will have to consider the outcome of investing in another platform where they can target a large audience. Not just investing in the platform but also investing time in developing new content design that adjusts to what the platform wants to promise its users. We’ve seen journalists choose adaptation through the vertical videos of Snapchat, square photos without links of Instagram, and the live feed of Periscope. In a way, technology is opening new ways for news to communicate to their audience. The platforms are being created whether news decides to move forward or not. This opens the door for new ways of being creative design wise.

    “It's getting more important for stories to be visually appealing.  Getting people to click on your stories, which you can usually do through a picture,” says Amanda Manning, journalism and design student at The New School University, “While some journalists will care more about the design aspect, perhaps the more famous journalists will care more about Twitter and snapchat, if they have a lot of followers. Depends on what audience they're looking for.”

<p>An example of a news outlet adapting to the change, is USA Today, the third largest newspaper in the United States. A case study presented in <em>Designing the Editorial Experience</em> by Sue Apfelbaum and Juliette Cezzar, talks about how from its origin USA Today was a news outlet for those who don’t have time. It was short. They used graphics and videos and bulleted articles. When they started, the authors say, USA Today was frowned upon, but now that people have even less time for news and our attention has reduced, their form of storytelling becomes a model for other news agencies. Their investment in video and initiation in working on mobile adaptation paid off.  With time, the news outlet realized that if their content was going to be fast paced then their identity had to show adaptability as well. Their logo goes from a globe icon into a simple dot that changes color depending on what section you are at. The use of simplicity, which brings adaptability, a key factor needed for journalism in a world where technology and communication continues to change.

        “A lot of my time was spent bridging the design over to their system, helping get NewsGate’s templates usable so their people didn’t have to build pages, because they weren’t always designers but rather editors, copy editors, and technicians.”

        Journalism is going to continually be challenged to be creative in how it presents itself to the audience and how it keeps up with where our attention is going. If everyone is on Periscope, how can they adjust their news and form of reporting to the huge audience that is on periscope. People are no longer going to the news. They are expecting the news to come to them. We expect the New York Times to send us a notification if there’s important news. We expect the news to adapt to the fact we like graphics and video more than text now. Journalism has to remain continuously adapting or find a way to create a platform and design that will automatically adapt to all platforms.

    As Jonah Peretti, CEO of Buzzfeed, said, “It doesn’t matter where your content lives”, what matters is how you get it to live on the other platforms where people are sharing with each other. </div>
