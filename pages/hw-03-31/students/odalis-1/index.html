    "I think journalists are going to have to think and report with these features in mind, in a way that past generations of journalists didn’t have to."

    <p>Journalism has entered an age in which the ways that the product is portrayed has to be done in a fashion where the reader/consumer can best grasp the information that is being given to them.</p>
    
    <p>Publications have started looking for ways to remain vibrant and fresh. Whether they're new to the scene or have been in circulation for years.</p>
    
    <span class="first graf"><p>Vanity Fair is a household name. From its original publication in 1913 and its subsequent rebirth in 1983, it is a staple for all things pop culture, fashion, and even current events. Vanity Fair Italia doesn’t stand too far from its parent flagship publication—and after a brief period of time with no creative director they are finally back under the larger Vanity Fair brand. I think this ties in with the way in which design in journalism is going forward. Especially when it comes to brands that are very recognizable and there are smaller publications gaining steam, the “long-time” traditional ones are looking for ways to remain relevant in such a fast moving environment. From reading the case study on VF Italia it seems that their creative director, Devin Pedzwater has an understanding about how this would work moving forward.</p></span>

    <div class="second graf"><p>One of his main goals for VF Italia was simplicity—especially for a magazine that is 300 pages. This is something that seems to be happening with a lot of websites as well. Sites such as Quartz have made that their trademark with the single scroll pages. And while there is a difference between a print editorial and something that is made for web, the theme that seems to be most important is to keep things simple. Vanity Fair Italia also does this with their fonts—where at one time they have from 15-20 different fonts the list has narrowed considerably. This helps with the simplicity aspect that a 300-page magazine could hope to achieve. Simplicity is also important for design in journalism going forward because it allows these publications to give off a cohesive look. Sometimes clutter and lack of white space feels too overwhelming for a reader and can turn them off from going to that website or purchasing the magazine.</p></div>
    

    <div class="third graf"><p>There are different levels of simplicity as well. Rookie mag, which has become a new household name in its own right, also has a form of simplicity to its site that I think has become a norm for new forms of publications. It is not about excessive use of white space, or even a uniform font (because Rookie does not adhere to that for their own image purposes) but there is still that cohesiveness to the site that does not make it look too outrageous or overcrowded. The aesthetic of the site allows it to have its quirky colors and fonts. While Vanity Fair Italia carries traditional simplicity, Rookie has changed it up to make it fit the way that a lot of teenagers view as creative.</p></div>

    <div class="caption">Rookiemag.com home page</div>

    <div class="fourth graf"><p>Both magazines do carry an understanding of accessibility. For Vanity Fair Italia its creative director knows that there needs to be access to the magazine not just via print but also the importance of a strong mobile presence. Especially with the stronger networks in Italy. And while there is still a solid print culture in Italy, there is still a necessity to also make an online image be presentable. Rookie is of course mostly online, with its printed “Yearbook” coming out at the end of the year, which makes it highly accessible for teens who are looking for content that is aimed at them. And while both of these publications go about this differently they value the importance of making their content easily accessible for their respective audiences. And they add uniqueness when it comes to their print medium. Whether it is in the more traditional Vanity Fair style, or the brand new feeling of Rookie.

    <div class="quote">Eugene Lang professor, Lauren Walsh, points out the importance of keeping a fresh perspective in terms of design in journalism, "news outlets will have to keep a finger on the pulse of the way online content–news or otherwise—is developing and will have to adapt accordingly, incorporating new ways of seeing, reading, and hearing the news." 
        
    <p>"The news publications that take advantage of the enormous interactive space that’s available digitally are smart. And the ones that push substantive news delivery—as opposed to incorporating new functionalities and designs for the sake of looking modern or being trendy—can do great work," highlights Walsh. She believes that there need to be some sort of pace in the ways in which publications should develop their design processes.</p>
        
    <p>VF Italia's creative director also believes in the sort of pacing that Walsh is calling for. Especially for their online presence. It would be easy to just slap on a webpage and let the pieces fall where they may. But Pedzwater understands that there has to be a smooth flow so that the readers enjoy their experience both in print and online.</p>
        
    <p>"Going forward, at least in the short term, I think journalists are going to have to think and report with these features in mind, in a way that past generations of journalists didn’t have to because they delivered content for a stable, standardized format, for instance the front page of X newspaper probably always used Y layout. With the rise in citizen journalism, I’m curious to see how official news outlets will incorporate material that hasn’t been as thoughtfully produced, in terms of design and other journalistic factors, but which is nonetheless newsworthy."</p></div>
