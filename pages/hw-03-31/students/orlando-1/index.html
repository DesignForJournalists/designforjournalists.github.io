<h1>Where is Design for Journlaism Headed?</h1>
<h4> by Orlando Mendiola</h4>
<h4> April 7, 2016</h4>

Advancement in technology continues to change the way we receive our news. Platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram make it easy for people to access the news from a variety of outlets. The more people subscribe to different publications, the more publications are changing their design methods. Publications are changing their design to adapt and appeal to a mass market of readers who access their content from different sites in order to keep the reader on their site and click on their articles. Established publications like New York magazine and The New York Times, are continuously finding new ways to merge their publications’ aesthetic to the world of web design while creating engaging content that interacts with the reader.</p>

New York magazine was established in 1968 after separating from the defunct newspaper, the New York Harold Tribune. The paper over the years has gone through different iterations. The magazines current editor, Adam Moss, who came to the publication in 2004, has transformed the magazine into an award-winning leader in design and content.
How New York magazine handles its online publication is a way that shows the continuing path that design for journalism is heading. Web design is something that is constantly changing, but its user experience, Steve Motzenbecker, Director of User Experience for NYmag.com says in the book Designing the Editorial Experience, that’s an important tool for designing for journalism. An artfully put together web page can look amazing, but it’s the site functionality that ultimately matters for the readers. If the site looks nice, but it’s hard to navigate, the rate of returning readers will drop.
The publication pays as much attention to the print version as they do the online publication. The print publication works in 5 different ways. The cover is given a team, and then the rest of the sections are split.</p>

<p>“The magazine is like four little magazines in one;” Thomas Alberty, Design Director for New York Magazine said in an interview from the book Designing the Editorial Experience. “Intelligencer, the features, the Strategist, and Culture pages.”
Alberty in the book describes the “design perspective” of New York as clear, refined, and witty.
“For me,” Alberty said in the book, “it’s a balance of keeping the magazine new while maintaining a continuity with its past.”
</p>

<p>Maintaining continuity with the past is something The New York Times, another long-running publication, strives to do as it continues to be an innovator in journalism and design. The New York Times has managed keep its overall basic newspaper design through the years as other publications tried to keep up with the changing trends. This continuity has made The Times a classic and shows that with minor changes, a long standing publication can keep a format that generations are familiar with while also keeping up with an array of competition.</p>

<p>“The `design of journalism` is more than just aesthetics,” Larry Buchanan, part-time lecturer at The New School and graphics editor for The New York Times said. “This becomes more and more apparent as technology changes. Designers, photographers, graphics editors, visual journalists will become more synonymous with reporters rather than being relegated to solely aesthetic functions. Visual journalists will go out into the field more, do more on the ground reporting, produce their own ideas, and experiment with the form of journalism to enhance the story they're trying to tell. When should this just be a list? When should it be an animation that reacts to scroll? When should it be a series of drawings with small captions that tell at larger story? These are inherently design questions, but if we come at them as journalists, the form we choose can enhance the journalism we're producing.”
</p>

<p>Writing and designing for print and online audience Buchanan said is different because for print, the elements can be denser since its obvious how that specific audience is experiencing that piece.</p>

<p>“They're seeing exactly what you want them to see,” Buchanan said, “in the exact context you want them to see it in (i.e. on paper, holding it, at a certain size, and resolution). So, graphics can be richer, and more full of information because you know how a reader is looking at that piece, and you know they might linger a bit longer. On the web, we're dealing with myriad screen sizes, browsers, resolutions, apps, social media — so your pieces have to be tighter, more controlled, the points possibly simpler and stronger, because you don't necessarily know the context in which a reader is viewing the piece. Writing for the Sunday print New York Times and writing for a snapchat-only piece are vastly different, each medium having it's own affordances good and bad."</p>

<p>As journalism and design continue to evolve into the online and mobile markets Buchanan says the most important thing that all platforms need is a good story.</p>

<p>“You can't think about form until you've though about the content and how those two will inform each other. Also, the question is infinitely complicated. "Print" vs "online" is a dramatic over simplification of the problem. In print, are you designing for a newspaper or a magazine or a newsletter or a book? On the web, are you designing for a phone? Tablet? Desktop? Twitter card? Facebook video? Apple Watch screen? There are few things that all of those forms have in common, but one thing is a good story. Compelling information that someone will find interesting.”
