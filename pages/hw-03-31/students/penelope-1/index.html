<h1>Where The Design Of Journalism Is Going... </h1>
<<a href="designforjournalists.github.io/pages/where-design-journalism-going" class="anchor">go home</a>

</div>
<p class="paragraph">The design world is bleeding into journalism through blunt cracks created by the technology industry. These cracks merge the journalist and the designer into one. Two examples of where the design of jouranlism is going can be seen from the magazine <a href="http://lettertojane.com" class="url">Letter to Jane</a> and <a href="http://readwax.com" class="url">WAX</a>. Both of these magazines capture the essence of how the future of design and jouranlism will be closer to a high-res movie screen than a 200-page book. </p>

<p class="paragraph2">David Yun, Cofounder and Cocreative Director of <a href="http://readwax.com" class="url">WAX Magazine</a>, discusses this idea of what it takes to be able to create design for editorial content in the most effective way.
<i>"Good design for editorial content is the same as good design for anything,"</i> Yun said. <i>"A strong concept and strategy that can be applied consistently from the cover to the art direction, down to the editorial voice."</i></p>

<p class="paragraph">This idea that Yun brings up about connecting the editorial voice with the art direction is what I believe the design of journalism is going. As it evolves, website aesthetics change into a more creative, more attractive and highly curated work. Furthermore, the concepts of editorial are advancing into focusing more one subject rather than having a number of different categories.</p>


<p class="paragraph2"> WAX is a surf magazine that isn't traditional in any sense. Rather it uses the <i>"visual language of art, fashion and design publications"</i> and portrays something close to an art-visual magazine. View video below.</p>

<p class="paragraph">Yun mentions that there are three main factors that contribute to the change in design over the past decade. From the financial crisis, to driving marketing partnerships, to the explosive small print pubilishing <i>"driving new journals and magazines,"</i> make up the direction in which design and journalism are headed. </p>

<p class="paragraph2"> Letter to Jane also focuses highly on their design landscape as it started out as a photography zine. Tim Moore, the founder and designer of LTJ, moved away from print due to the manual labor and preparation it required. Focusing on the iPad, he is able to explore the relationship between user and magazine. He believes in the physicality of touching and holding something, <i>"[He] really liked how [he] could view photos one at a time,"</i> Moore said. <i>" It was very pure, like you're holding the image"</i></p>

<p class="paragraph">Similar to Yun's design perspective, Moore discussed the importance of creating a good editorial experience by building the relationship at the beginning by connecting the design to the subject. View art-based video below. </p>

<p class="paragraph2">With the use of the iPad, Moore believes that it doesn't subsitute for a small magazine because it's more than that&mdash;it's about the high-res visuals that are huge (in pixels). It's about the simplicity, the cleanliness and the boldness. </p>

<p class="paragraph"><i>"I was just thinking, okay, I have one screen, how do I make that look good, and then go to the next screen,"</i> Moore said. <i>"I think the iPad's strength is that you can be very simple."</i> He believes that iPad magazine design relates a lot to the design of posters because you have to be simple and bold, <i>"You have to tell a story with a lot less."</i></p>

<p class="paragraph2">Moore uses the interconnectivity to track how people are using the iPad magazine (app). He focuses on analytics, something I believe is a growing trend and ties into what Yun was talking about when thinking about marketing&mdash;We have to look to what people want, how they want it and where they're getting stuck in order to make the user have the most enjoyable experience. </p>

<p class="paragraph">Both Yun and Moore have simple designs to their layouts and clear and concise text that allows for an easy and enjoyable read. In hopes of understanding more about where the design of journalism is headed I asked a few of my peers what they thought. </p>

<p class="paragraph2"><i>"It's all online nowadays,"</i> Ben Smith, a junior at Eugene Lang focusing on Music journalism, said. <i>"I think it will continue to get more intense online with videos, like documentaries, and photographs. I mean look at Apple and how crazy good the iPhone is right now...if that's the quality on a cell phone, the quality for any magazine has got to be better at the very least...or have some sort of crazy cool aeschetic."</i></p>

<p class="paragraph">I asked a friend of mine who isn't a journalist but very active online about where she thinks the design of journalism is headed: <i>"It's definitely more online than it's ever been,"</i> Shawn Marom, a junior at Eugene Lang College studying arts and culture, said. <i>"I think the more art centric the work is the more the desire for it to be physical, something you can touch and hold, aka print or I guess touch screen but who knows."</i>
