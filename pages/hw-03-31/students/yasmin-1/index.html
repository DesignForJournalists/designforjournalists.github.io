      <p> “Digital journalism is where we are going to go!” exclaims Terry Golway, a senior editor at Politico New York. Over the past decade the design of journalism has changed immensely as a result of the digital age. In current day, most of society gets their information, whether it is news or tabloid gossip, from the Internet. Print publications are now being forced to adapt to the digital age by creating a strong web presence. While news organizations are moving online by creating smart phone applications and mobile friendly websites, a tremendous amount of news comes directly from social media. Now, news organizations are embedding themselves directly into the social media used constantly by so many. An example of this would be Snapchat’s somewhat-new discover feature which allows publications such as the Wall Street Journal to create interactive graphics, charts, and statistics to grab the viewers attention and link them to full news articles. Something that Buzzfeed does very well. </p>

      <p> Digital-first publication, BuzzFeed has not only integrated itself into features like Snapchat’s discover but also has an incredibly strong web presence mastering “listicles” (list article) and have created engaging and interactive articles with strong visuals. It cannot be denied that, “Anyone publishing news or content of any kind on the web in 2013 had to look at the BuzzFeed phenomenon and ask, ‘How do they do it?’ And by ‘it’ we mean hit six-digit sit traffic numbers daily and create sponsored content that its readers unquestioningly want to engage with.” (64). Designed around the “social web” and sharing, turns crowd-generated news from other websites into sharable stories while also focusing on quality long-form political journalism, proving that it is possible to have high- and low-brow coexist on the same platform. Golway explained the importance of incorporating high- and low-brow journalism on a single platform as, “Blogging just doesn’t cut it, reporting is reporting. Opinion is cheap, reporting is expensive,”. Additionally, making articles sharable is incredibly important to appeal to “a generation used to getting news for free” as described by Golway who goes further to explain that “a lot of people expect their news for free but reporting is expensive”, so BuzzFeed repurposing information from websites such as Reddit. Chris Johanesen, Vice President of Product at BuzzFeed and BuzzFeed’s second hired employee and first designer explains that they try to let the content tell the story in terms of design.</p>

      <p>“We tend to take the simplest tack with things like this: present the content simply, all on one page, and let the reader decide how to consume it”      – Chris Johanesen (VP of Product at Buzzfeed)</p>

      <p>“The media world has changed so much since 9/11 and in the past 15 years. Who knows what the design of journalism will be like in 15 years from now, but I probably won’t be traipsing outside my house to pick up a wet newspaper lying on the ground outside. That act will probably be as archaic as listening to Bob Pope on the radio.” –Terry Golway (senior editor at Politico New York)</p>

      <p> Another online publication known as Editorially was created as “a new form of web-based application ‘designed to help writers and editors work more effectively together,’” (126). However, though both web based publications, Editorially has a much narrower audience than BuzzFeed and is much less social, though still social for its kind of content. Despite its simple, aesthetically pleasing articles, featuring illustrations and a smart phone application it “failed to attract enough users to be sustainable” (Editorially) and had to close its doors February 12th, 2014. </p>

      <p> The design of journalism centers completely around the web, integrating itself into social media websites, creating applications, sending emails, and making articles graphically strong in order to compete with other web content in order to attract an audience. This is the reason why in the past year BuzzFeed has placed a tremendous amount of focus on integrating itself into other web content and taking the time to calculate its statisics in order to improve. </p>
