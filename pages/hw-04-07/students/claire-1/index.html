Dear Reader,
<BR>
Welcome to The Face! The Face came out of looking and reading many blog but never finding much about those that are younger and are in the working world. The Face is a source for those who aren’t sure exactly what they what they wanna be “when they grow up”, it’s an exploration of careers, fashion, beauty and lifestyle. To give you our reader a wide scope into a “grown up world”. With the The Face we hope to show a new generation of employees, how diverse the job market as well people can be. The Face aims to bring to you in depth interview with working women and men at least once a week. As well as small advice, fashion and beauty tips throughout the week. Through this blog we hope you can discover many new and exciting potential careers and have fun.
