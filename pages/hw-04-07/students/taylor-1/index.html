    DOPE PEOPLE DO DOPE THINGS.
  </div>

  <br></br>

  <div class="Opening">Dear Dope Fiends,</div>

  <div class="Letter">
    You’re young, cool, fresh, and hungry. You’ll do just about anything (and maybe anyone) for it. You think about it constantly. You dream about. You itch and squirm; you shake, twitch, and squeal between those moments without it. You need to have it…<strong>SUCCESS.</strong>
  <br></br>
    Well, we’ve got it for you right here. Dope is an online, bi-weekly publication that showcases and covers the works of young, people of color. From designers to writers, to business entrepreneurs and activists, we give you the newest, up-and-coming, dope game-changers of our time. Dope people do dope things. We seek them out and ask them questions about their dopeness— about their success.
<br></br>
    Dope seeks to close the gap between young achievers/strivers and their dreams. We look to create awareness around these creatives and seek to inspire others who want to do the same.
<br></br>
    Every two weeks, Dope will release a <strong>“dose of dope”</strong> (featured article) on a specific individual that is making waves in the field they are in. With these articles, we hope to inspire, create awareness and community, as well as break down barriers between success and young people of color.
<br></br>
    We live in a world that likes to hush the 18 year old black girl, or ignore the 20 year old Latino. We are constantly being shown one version of ourselves, which sometimes isn’t always the best one. Dope seeks to take back that identity and feed its community with positive access to who we really are— young, creative, and successful.
<br></br>
    Dope is a platform that will not only allow for this to happen, but to shake up stereotypes and misconceptions that hinder the world from seeing the awesome talent that is manifesting from communities of young people of color.
<br></br>
    Every other Friday, visit us at <span class="link">www.dopeshit.com</span> [this site] to see your featured Dose of Dope on the homepage. You can also follow us on Instagram <span class="link">(_dopeshit.)</span> and Twitter <span class="link">(@dopeshit)</span> where we post daily updates on our interviews, events, and random shit that will keep you woke.
