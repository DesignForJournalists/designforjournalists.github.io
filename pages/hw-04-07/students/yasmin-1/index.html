      <p>Welcome to our first issue of WATER magazine. We are called WATER because we are a publication that will take on many forms during the course of our lifetime and water does just that. It takes on the shape of anything it touches and we would like to do the same. We will tackle a specific theme or subject per issue and we will do our best to find people who we love and whose work we want to share speak of this subject.</p>
		  <p>Our first issue tackles the color BLUE. </p>
		  <p>Blue has been used in art, decoration and as a clothing dye for thousands of years. The semi-precious stone lapis lazuli, was used by the Egyptians for jewellery and later, in The Renaissance, to make the pigment ultramarine, the most expensive of all pigments. During the Middle Ages, cobalt blue was used to color the stained glass windows of cathedrals. Blue dyes for clothing were made from woad and indigo in Europe, Asia and Africa are still in use today. In art Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Vincent van Gogh and other late 19th century painters used ultramarine and cobalt blue not just to depict nature, but to create moods and emotions. Picasso devoted an entire period around that color and Yves Klein invented and patented his own version. </p> 
		  <p>Then we have the Blues… sad and melancholic yet exquisite with even a special note — the Blue Note to depict even more melancholy...</p>
      <p>But we will take a even broader look at blue because, like everything else in this world, things are never as simple as they seem. </p>
      <p>To quote Vincent Van Gogh,</p>
      <p>"There is no blue without yellow and without orange."</p>
