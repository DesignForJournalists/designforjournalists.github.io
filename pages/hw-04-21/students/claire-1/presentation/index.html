    <div class="title">On the beach: a critical guide to surf and sand {presentation}</div>
    
    <div class="text">I hope that with this redesign of MAGAZINE NAME, choosing a small section that relates to surviving the heat and summer while living in NYC my viewers will find helpful tips.Iâ€™m trying to give off a more editorial feel of the article, and I am serializing it by putting up sections week by week. Telling followers to join in groups to go to the beach posted live on the website. Once all the beaches and their subsequent information has been posted, it will stay live, so that it is always accessible to our reader. This will hopefully allow and help New Yorkers to explore new fun places a little outside the city on their summer fridays. </div>
