<div class="Vision">The vision of this article and the experience that it provides is valuable because it presents the opportunity for engagement and community to be created amongst not only readers, but between the reader and the content. It brings the article to life in a way that digital can’t. It is organic, rough, and adventurous— like the city the article will be experienced in and like the content of the article.
