        <h1>Scope</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>You will design and print the very first issue of a “zine”.</li>
            <li>The name of your zine must be: The Newer School News.</li>
            <li>You can decide what the magazine is about. (What many things can “The Newer School News” mean? What do you want it to be?)</li>
            <li>You can decide exactly where it is distributed, exactly when, and exactly how often. Imagine your magazine not beholden in any way by distribution or financial limitations.</li>
            <li>Through subject matter, voice, tone, brand, and means of distribution, the zine should evoke a certain tone, personality, set of values, and perspective.</li>
            <li>It must be printed in black and white ink.</li>
            <li>
            It must include:<br>
              - a cover (front and back)<br>
              - a masthead<br>
              - an editor’s letter<br>
              - 1 front matter article<br>
              - 1 feature article<br>
              - 1 back-matter article<br>
            </li>
            <li>It can be any size, but it must be in saddle-stitch, page-spread format.</li>
            <li>When you shape the magazine, it should implicitly or explicitly evoke: who the target audience is and why the zine worth their reading? Additionally, you should clearly be able to articulate these two things.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>April 27</strong> / final presentations</p>
        <ul>
            <li>At least 3 copies of the zine, printed and bound.</li>
            <li>printed at print center (plan ahead with print shop).</li>
            <li>using chosen paper (buy paper well in advance).</li>

            <li>final copy and design in place.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>May 04</strong> / final presentations</p>
        <ul>
            <li>2-3 images of the zine for me to post on the zine collection page. Each image should be a jpg file under 100kb. Stylistically, here is a nice example to follow by <a href="http://www.melissadeckert.com/#/prattonia/" target="_blank">Melissa Deckert</a> Your image files should be saved in a project folder. Label the project folder as your first name (ex: <strong>dylan</strong> – one word, all lowercase). Label the image files exactly like so: <strong>zine-1.jpg</strong>, <strong>zine-2.jpg</strong>, <strong>zine-3.jpg</strong>. Upload the folder to our shared google drive folder by 10:00AM next Thursday.</li>
            <li>A project title, subtitle, and a 70 word description, submitted <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/dylangreif.com/spreadsheets/d/14a_9yCMTslwEoq9tOFfOVLioknUGcaBt8sEfdLRy3ho/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">in this google spreadsheet</a>.</li>
