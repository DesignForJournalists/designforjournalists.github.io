			<h1>Penpal Project</h1>
		</header>
        <h1>A letter a week</h1>
        <p>Create “breaking news” as a poster. The subject matter is a hypothetical news story that you imagine could happen in the next 10-15 years. Conceive it as a poster that will be mailed to a hypothetical audience/recipient. You will collaborate on this project with a student from RISD’s “Editorial Design for Screen” class. You will wear the “journalist” hat. Your penpal will wear the “designer” hat. You will collaborate with your partner by writing postcards to each other every week.</p>
        <p>I will be your postman. Every week, you will hand me your latest corresondence, and I will give you your penpals. The project will go through three phases, throughout the semester.</p>
        <p>See the schedule below for deadlines. These deadlines indicate what you and your partner will be expected to complete by certain dates throughout the semester.</p>
