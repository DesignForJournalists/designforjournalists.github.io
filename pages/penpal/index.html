        <h1>"Breaking News"</h1>
        <p>Create “breaking news” as a poster. The subject matter is a hypothetical news story that you imagine could happen in the next 10-15 years. Conceive it as a poster that will be mailed to a hypothetical audience/recipient. You will collaborate on this project with a student from RISD’s “Editorial Design for Screen” class. You will wear the “journalist” hat. Your penpal will wear the “designer” hat.</p>
        <p>You will start collaborating with your partner by writing postcards to each other every week. I will be your postman. Every week, you will hand me your latest corresondence, and I will give you your penpal's. After 3 weeks, you will transition to whatever means of communication you prefer.</p>
        <p>See the schedule below for deadlines.</p>
        <h1>The schedule</h1>
        <p>These deadlines indicate what you and your partner will be expected to deliver by certain dates throughout the semester. These deliverables should be evident in the postcard correspondence you write, even if you aren't perfectly in sync with your penpal.</p>
