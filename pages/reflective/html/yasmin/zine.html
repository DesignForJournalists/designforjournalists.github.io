			<h3> Assignment: </h3>
		<p class="assignment">Design and print the very first issue of a zine. Decide what the magazine is about. Create your zine for a specific audience in New York City. Devise an exact time, frequency, and place you want a zine to be distributed. The subject matter, articles, personality, brand, and time/frequency/place of distribution should embody a certain set of values and perspective. Make deliberate decisions about: your color palette, fonts used, typographic hierarchy, grid/layout, paper choices.</p>

		<h3> (Not so brief)-Brief: </h3>
		<p class="assignment">soap is a zine that documents my friends’ showering routines through a series of photos and bits of conversation between us. showering is personally one of my favorite things to do and i’ve recently realized how specific and particular my routine is to my friends’. soap came about by wanting to highlight the discovery of our differences and similarities in showering, and embracing the unique quirks. 
		it’s about my friends, for my friends. </p>

		<p class="assignment">soap will be available for my friends to take a single copy each, once a month at one of our house parties. each issue will feature three different people every time and it is meant to feel like an exclusive piece of memorabilia for us to have about one another. it also encourages my friends to all gather once a month, hang out, laugh and leave with something special. 
		soap is an embodiment of our friendships and dynamics. </p>

		<p class="assignment">soap includes three of my friends. the front cover begins from the top [head] and the back cover ends with the bottom [toes]. inside is my editor’s letter and their three stories. no conventional masthead, everything is done by me and my friends know that. montserrat is used all throughout as the only type for a clean design and an easy read, as it isn’t copy heavy. unedited film photos superposed and laid out randomly within stories across spreads, to emphasize the raw aspect of naked bodies in that experience as well as the spontaneous and natural flow of the conversation. it follows a 12-column grid to allow for layout freedom, as within each story there is no timeline or order in which sections need to be read. the blocks of color were chosen to bring forth elements within the photographs that describe and emphasize their individual story and routine. printed on milkweed 32lb paper for a nice tint and texture, thick enough to sustain basic wear and tear, with a classic rubber band for binding. this allows for the zine to be taken apart, hung as individual posters and put back together.</p>

		<h3> Reflection: </h3>
		<p class="assignment">A lot of trial and error. Really. A lot. I think this was probably my favorite assignment and it happened at the perfect time where we had covered the basics on typography, layout (print/digital) and getting familiar with inDesign where I didn't feel unprepared. It was an opportunity to apply everything that I had learned and make whatever I wanted in a zine. I like that it was a zine because it allowed for less strict editorial rules, whereas a magazine or book would have restricted some creative freedom and made it more complex to complete a really strong product. Figuring out a grid system and sticking to it was quite challenging as well, and something I was unaware needed to be followed for zines. The printing process was just as crucial, because that is when your layout and design are really put through the lithmus test. I chose to have some elements of texts and graphics layed ontop across a spread, which isn't usually very smart or easy for reasons that they can be botched up with bleed marks and print crops when bound, so this was something I needed to account for whilst revising my inDesign file after the first draft print. This assignment really gave me a taste of what it takes to put together a product, like a zine, from start to finish, which was one of the most valuable experiences. Every single decision had the potential to completely alter the world I was putting together, which was a scary challenge but well worth it. I think if I had more time I would definitely want to re-design and re-imagine what this zine content would look like with another design concept. It would be interesting to see the different interations and look at what works best, whether it's a subjective opinion or not. As well, I would work on getting better product shots.</p>
