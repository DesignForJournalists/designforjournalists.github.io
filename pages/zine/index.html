			<h1>Zine Project – Assignment</h1>

        <!--<p><a href="work.html">View final work</a></p>-->
        
        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>What is a zine? Check out <a href="http://www.rookiemag.com/2012/05/how-to-make-a-zine/">this article by Rookie magazine about zines.</a></li>
            <li>You will design and print the very first issue of a zine.</li>
            <li>You will decide what the magazine is about.</li>
            <li>You will create your zine for a specific audience in New York City (e.g. your classmates, your local park, people who like to knit...)</li>
            <li>You will devise an exact time, frequency, and place you want a zine to be distributed (the subway every say, three times a year at a Friday night dinner party, a rooftop party once a month...)</li>
            <li>The subject matter, articles, personality, brand, and time/frequency/place of distribution should embody a certain set of values and perspective.</li>
            <li>
            The zine must include:<br>
              - a cover (front and back)<br>
              - a masthead<br>
              - an editor’s letter<br>
              - 1 front matter article<br>
              - 1 feature article<br>
              - 1 back-matter article<br>
            If you have a very good reason, you can opt to structure your zine in a way that doesn't specifically include a front matter article, feature article, and back matter article.
            </li>
            <li>It can be any size smaller than 9.5" height x 7.5" wide</li>
            <li>The binding needs to be single-signature bound (via saddle staple, saddle stitch, or rubber band).</li>
        </ul>

            <li>Plan for 2-3 "portfolio images" of the zine. (Stylistically, here is a nice example to follow by <a href="http://www.melissadeckert.com/#/prattonia/" target="_blank">Melissa Deckert</a>)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Nov 02 / <strong>due Nov 09</strong></p>

            <li>PDF in color</li>
            <li>2-3 portfolio images of the zine for me to post on the zine collection page. Each image should be a jpg file under 100kb.  Your image files should be saved in a project folder. Label the project folder as your first name (ex: <strong>dylan</strong> – one word, all lowercase). Label the image files exactly like so: <strong>zine-1.jpg</strong>, <strong>zine-2.jpg</strong>, <strong>zine-3.jpg</strong>. Upload the folder to our shared google drive folder by 10:00AM that Thursday.</li>
            <li>First draft of a 2-3 paragraph decription of your zine explaining each bullet in the overview above, submitted on Slack by 10:00AM.</li>
