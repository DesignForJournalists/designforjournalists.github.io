			<h1>Zine Project – Final Work</h1>
		</header>
        <br><br>
        <p>Below is the work students submitted for the midterm. (You can view the <a href="index.html">full assignment description here</a>.) Each student conceived, authored, designed, printed, and produced the very first issue of a zine. Their starting point was defining a specific distribution method for a specific audience in a specific time and place, and determining the content and concept from there. Through subject matter, voice, tone, brand, and means of distribution, the final product needed to evoke a certain tone, personality, set of values, and perspective. It could be any size, but had to be bound in a single signature, printed in black and white ink, and include: a cover, a masthead, an editor’s letter, a front-matter article, a feature article, and a back-matter article. Three copies needed to be produced.</p>

            <img src="images/alexis/zine-1.jpg">
            <p>The rivalry between the East and the West- My Zine titled, “XYZ” showcases the rivalry between New York City and Los Angeles. It gives an insight into what each place is really like and offers quotes and examples from other opinion based articles. The zine as a whole is very easy to read and includes nice graphics and pictures that add to the experience. Each page has some sort of a graphic, whether it be a wave, a picture of NYC, or tiny stars scattered throughout the page. The two main articles focus on NYC and LA. One article is specifically for each, and in the end, it’s up to the reader to decide which coast they believe is the “best coast.”</p>

            <p>FindMe is an interactive and participatory zine meant to serve as a clue and introduction to an underground party held twice a year. That being said, it is semiannual, in accordance with the event it represents. The zine holds a riddle hinting towards the location of the (limited) tickets for the party, while highlighting the exclusive artists the event will revolve around. It is a scavenger hunt for the reader. It is meant to be an entity of its own, one of a kind—yet, part of a collective. FindMe is a game.</p>

            <p>An unscheduled zine dedicated to the nastiest place during the nastiest time. Inspired by the bewilderment that comes with the disgustingness of rubbing elbows in New York City during the summer, Heatwave uses the color black as a cooling backdrop while utilizing inverted colors, the city's sweatiest voices, and what the fire hydrants of God look like upon a printed paper.</p>

            <p>Amazin Magazine is a zine dedicated to Amanda Miner, who passed away on March 16th while she was celebrating her 21st birthday. Amanda was one of my best friends and I decided to pay homage to her by telling a very small snippet of her through photos acquired from social media. Using select images from my print zine to bring the colors of her personality to life, I want everyone to know how awesome Amanda was.</p>

            <p>This zine is meant to be a 'playbill' type handout that is meant to be given to audience members as they enter DIY venues. Often at these type of venues, audience members only know one or two of the bands (four to five perform each night) since most are little-known or touring bands. This zine is meant to promote a sense of community, giving info, lyrics, photos, album reviews, interviews and upcoming dates on the bands performing. For this edition I made it for the Vundabar, Horse Jumper of Love, and Tall Friend show at Silent Barn on April, 7.</p>
